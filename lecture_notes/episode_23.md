# Episode 23 - Romanticism

##  Hobbes
+ materialism
+ cognition is computation

## Descartes
+ saving the human soul, cost: mind-body/mind disconnection
+ 2 models of reality (that we swing between):
    - math --> positivism
    - mind touching itself (cogito ergo sum), subjective notion of realness --> Romanticism
        + I: atomic moment of self-awareness; empty of history, tradition, autobiography
        
## Pascal
+ spirit of geometry: still have it
+ spirit of finesse: (ppp) lost

## Crises: mental health, environmental, socio-political
+ --> we need fundamental transformation in consciousness, character, cognition, community
+ --> restructure our relationship to ourselves, others and the world

### Past psychotechs: religion
+ Cartesian & protestant heritage: secularization, OR
+ return to a pre-scientific model, fundamentalism
+ --> still need a multi-level transformation (consciousness, character, cognition, community)
+ --> hard problem: need a religion that's not a religion

secular solution: pseudo-religious ideologies --> genocide, warfare

+ we cannot return to religion
+ we cannot return to the political-secular alternatives
+ --> we are stuck

#### Neoplatonic: 
+ reality is grounded in intelligible form (idos), that are abstract, eternal --> ultimate grounding

#### Scientific revolution: 
+ Math is the language of the universe

#### Occam's razor: 
+ all the patterns in intelligibility that you think are in the world are actually in your mind

## Kant
+ Cartesian legacy:
    + why is math so powerful
    + all I have is access to my own mind
+ proposal:
    - the mathematical properties are not actually there
    - experience is not features in the world --> experience has to be organized to make sense in the mind
+ (analogy:
    - world is very blurry, too much info --> have to apply filtering frames)
- structures in the mind: filtering frames  --> imposing a structure of intelligibility on experience
- opposite of the platonic model (Copernican reversal) ???
    + moving into the mind, away from reality
- not discovering the patterns in the world: but the pattern is imposed on the info coming in --> to make sense/fit in my mind --> use it to reason about the world
- I can reason about the world (which is absurd in itself) after filtering my mind can process according to its own grammar
- Copernical reversal: not discovering the math properties of the world --> my mind is filtering and imposing the incoming info in order to make sense of it
- inverting the world from Plato:
    + math is not discovering reality
    + math is how the mind imposes a structure on reality so to reason about it
    + --> relevance
+ processing
    + bottom up: perception --> cognition (in service of the rational*)
    + top down: cognition/knowledge --> perception
           + mind is imposing a structure and filters the info coming in
           + cognition becomes more rational --> farther from the world
           + platonic reversion: rationality moves away from being contact with reality
    + dynamic between them: (eg. THE CHT, TAE CAT)

`(Jung = Kant + Gnostics)`

## Romanticism

- revert Kant:
    + moving into the irrational/unconscious places of the mind --> more in touch with reality
    + dreamlike, unconscious experiences, imaginary --> gaining back the lost contact with the world
- picking up on Pascal
    + recapturing the lost participatory-perspectival knowing
    + involved contact of reality, reaching out to the world
- (--> Freud: reaching down to the psyche, Jung: down and out)
- moving away the from rational layers of cognition, to the irrational --> closer to reality
- association with love:
     * the form of PP knowing is love: the irrational force
- perception (down) -- imagination -- reason (up)
- imagination
    * where the mind imposes order on the raw data of experience (=! fantasizing )
    * thus it becomes available to reason
    * access through imagination to what's real: music, art
    --> meaning is made that we can rationally reflect upon
Opposing views/models: (both wrong)

#### Enlightenment:
+ Locke: mind is a blank slate, empty canvas, on which
    + sensory experience writes, im-press-es on mind
#### Romanticism:
+ the world is an empty canvas on which
    + the mind/imagination ex-press-es itself (--> projection)

### Criticism of Romanticism
+ pan-european movement
+ integrates music, art, literature, making meaning --> to regain contact with reality <-- like what religion used to do
    + also experimentation altered states of consciousness: hypnosis, drugs
+ predecessor of pseudo-religious ideology: bad bullshit
+ still trapped inside your mind
+ romantic relationship: carry all the weight of religion, tradition, philosophy, history <-- unreachable expectations
+ no wisdom tradition, system of psychotechs, guides for transformative experiences
+ --> left with the words/images/promises only, no practices, institutions
    + spiritual junk-food: tasty, but not nutritious
    + --> French revolution, Napoleon wars (re-structuring the world)
+ Romanticism fails:
    + to replace religion
    + but doesn't go away (decadent romanticism): romantic comedies, porn

## Schopenhauer

+ priority of the will
+ internalizes Occam --> Luther --> Kant (inversion of Luther) --> inversion of Kant*
    + up: rational (out of touch with the world)
    + down: irrational (imagination, expression: act of will**)
+ arbitrary will** (like God), ego
      + will to live: what drives you, relentless, pointless
+ "sex is the cruel joke that the species plays on the individual"
    + sex
        + is the will to live,
        + filters your experience,
        + promises you meaning (what religion used to do)
        + leaves you empty
+ we are all just replicator machines
+ nihilism, pessimism
+ if you remove the connection between meaning making and rationality --> high cost
+ what do you have: meaningless existence
     + unconscious arbitrary will to live --> what for ?
     + art and music gives momentary breaks from the will to live
+ romanticism & nihilism linked together

## Nietzsche (<-- Wagner, Schopenhauer)
+ godfather of postmodernism
+ Wagner, Luther: anti-semites
    + followers of the law are trying earn their salvation --> Jews are evil
+ inverts the will to live --> rejects Kant, Plato
+ everything has a will to power
    + feature of everything
    + extend, create, master oneself in the world
    + stop negating it, stop being so Christian, let's accept it, indulge it
    + the desire to transcend oneself
    + lets not suppress/repress/condems it --> removes pessimism --> getting back meaning
+ criticism (many voices of N):
    + reason is still a logical framing
    + self-transformation without reason/rationality to deal with self-deception
    + no psychtech to train you to overcome self-deception
    + --> tragedy: wants self-transcendence, aware of self-deception, but no machinery, method
    + --> satire, self-undermining, endless critique (post-modernism)
    + danger in self-trancendence withut rationality
