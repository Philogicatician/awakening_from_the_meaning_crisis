# Episode 02 - Flow, Metaphor and the Axial Revolution

## Upper-paleolithic Transition - Cognitive Revolution (History)

+ formative us as human beings
+ cognitive exaptation
    + of trade, initiation, healing rituals
+ new psychotechnologies --> shamanism
+ meaning making, self-transcending and spirituality together
+ chaos and warfare is part of the natural order

### Shamanism

> Set of psychotechs to reach altered states of consciousness to cognitively exapt enhanced abilities that trade/initiation/healing rituals had already been creating.

+ disruptive strategies to alter frame of reality
    + our frame of reality / how we find patterns is a source of
         + our adaptivity
         + self deception
    + enhancing meaning making, insight, help with hunting healthcare

+ disruptive strategies/practices for altered states of consciousness/changes in attention
    + sleep/sex deprivation, chanting, dancing, psychedelics
    + bring radical changes in how the brain operates
+ getting into the flow state
    + insight cascade
    + enhanced implicit learning, intuition
    + "soul flight", getting high

## Flow State (CogSci)

+ "being in the zone"

### Description, Environmental Conditions - Csíkszentmihály

> You are involved in a task that is very demanding. The demands of the situation just slightly go beyond your skill abilities.

Challenges | Skills | Skills
--- | --- | ---
-- | Low | High
High | Anxiety | Flow Channel
Low | Flow Channel | Boredom

+ extending the skills to meet demands: getting into the **flow channel**
    + if my skills exceed the demands, I fall into boredom
    + if my demands exceed the skills, I fall into anxiety
+ tight coupling between you and the env
+ we are good at learning in situation
    + as your skills improve, your env also improves
+ flow induction machines: tight feedback between what you do and how the env responds
    + feedback, failure matters
    + eg. video games, playing jazz, martial arts, rock climbing
+ flow state is deeply positive for people
    + != physical pleasure
    + more flow state ~ more wellbeing, meaning in life
+ universal state (across cultures, classes, languages, ages)
+ **at-onement**
    + big metabolic energy used, but feels effortless
        + spontaneity
        + sense of time changes
        + sense of self changes: self-consciousness disappears
            + doing our autobiography, ruminations (<--depression)
            + image management
+ super-salient: brightness
+ optimal experience
    + people like it, seek it & do their best work in it
+ conditions:
    1. match between skills and demands
    2. you need clear information, feedback
    3. failure has to matter
+ training that helps you to get into the flow state
    + eg. mindfulness

### Cognitive Mechanism of the Flow State - Vervaeke et al.

#### Phenomenology of Flow State

+ the patterns aren’t just patterns in your mind, they’re patterns and knowing how to make sense of things.

#### Why is the flow state improving cognition ?

+ dynamic between framing and finding new patterns:
    + eg. rock climber getting stuck --> breaks the frame: restructure what you are finding relevant --> change yourself to fit that / refit yourself to the rock face --> repeat
    + eg. jazz musician picking up on a pattern > restructure --> shift to a new pattern --> repeat
+ cascade of insights: insight leading to another insight
    + extended aha

Implicit learning 
+ picking up on complex patterns outside of conscious processing
    + detecting pattern not knowing how
+ how people can learn language
    + experiment 1: people guess above change if a string is generated by complex rules they were shown only the outputs of
         + but: cannot state the rules themselves
+ experiment 2: "feeling" of staring
     + blindfolded participants have to guess if someone is staring at them
     + the starers are introduced to the room by a complex pattern
     + if feedback is given
         + participants can guess above chance
     + if no feedback is given
         + participants cannot guess above chance
     + conclusion:
         + feedback matters !
         + we cannot learn random stuff
+ intuition (Hogarth: Educating Intuition)
     + not magical/supernatural, but implicit learning
     + intuition == bias
         + bias: when implicit learning goes bad (eg. prejudice) - correlation
              + eg. bigger wedding and long-lasting marriage
         + intuition - causation
              + training your implicit learning to pick up on causational patterns that are real
     + how to explicitly train unbiased intuition:
          + set up/control the env/context like in science
              + science: distinguishing causal pattern from correlational patterns
              1. clear measurement/info
              2. clear feedback (tight coupling between what you do and how the environment responds)
              3. failure/error matters
          + --> same conditions for good intuition as for flow

Relationship between Insight and Implicit Learning: 
    + reinforcement:
        + insight makes your cognition explore new patterns
        + implicit learning picks up on the new patterns and restructures them in a new frame --> new insight
        + insight makes your cognition explore new patterns

#### Flow and Mystical Experience

+ powerful altered state of consciousness enhancing cognitive processing
+ shaman is making meaning:
    + altering what matters to people
    + altering the sense of identity of people --> transform/heal people

#### Flow and Enhanced Cognition

+ flow (& insight & intuition) connects brain areas that normally are not talking to each other
    + disruption strategies (fasting, social isolation, psychedelics) further enhance it
    + eg. our cognitive capacity for **metaphor** (etymology: meta: across, phero: carry; meaning: to bridge between)

Metaphor (Lakoff)

+ making creative connection between ideas
+ cognition is filled with them (eg. under-stand, grasp, super-vision)
    + metaphorical cognition is at the heart of science and art
+ embodied mind generating metaphors during flow
+ connection between metaphor and problem solving/insight
    + metaphor helps in restructuring
+ shaman's soul flight and flying above
    + they are getting complex patterns: are above the ordinary

## Bronze Age - Neolithic Revolution (History)

+ 10000 BC
+ invention of agriculture
    + staying at the same place
    + complex societies: relationship between people and to themselves changes
+ collapse: greatest collapse of civilization
    + don't exactly know why
    + Dark Age

## Axial Age

+ 800-300 BC
+ formative us as Western civilization
+ experimentation after the Dark Age
    + alphabetic literacy: a much more effective psychotech
        + easier, more effective --> expands
        + improves ability to learn, access and share
        + externalization of thoughts -->
        + improves reflection, awareness of thoughts, correction of thoughts

        + --> second order thinking: metacognition (awareness of your own mind) <-- exaptaion
            + internalize literacy into metacognition
            + internalize a psychotech into our cognition
     + money, coinage
        + abstract symbol system
        + exaptation: start thinking in abstract symbol systems
        + numeracy, arithmetics

+ literacy --> exaptation: second order thinking/metacognition (--> knowing myself better)
+ coinage --> exaptation: abstract symbolic thought (knowing the world better)

+ second order thinking & abstract symbolic systems--> changes cognition
    + correcting cognition; self-transcendence
    + awareness and capacity for self-deception
    + --> capacity for self-correction & self-deception
    + change in sense of self and the world
        + sense of responsibility --> morality
        + sense of responsibility for the violence/chaos
    + no enemy greater than your own mind & no ally greater than your own mind
        + cognition is a double-edge sword
            + undisciplined: self-deception/illusion --> violence
            + disciplined: self-correction/transcendence --> wisdom --> reduce violence & suffering
