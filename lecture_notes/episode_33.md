# Episode 33 - The Spirituality of RR: Wonder/Awe/Mystery/Sacredness

## Recap

#### Naturalistic Explanation of RR

>  Self-organizing criticality in a small world network formation in the brain.

#### Applications, properties of RR

+ the naturalistic explanation helps understanding:
    + GI
    + insight
    + functionality (and phenomenology maybe) of consciousness
    + features of human spirituality
        + transjectivity
        + connectedness:
            + mind to world
            + mind to body
            + mind to mind
+ RR is affective
    + caring: what to commit to cognitively, as our resources are finite

## Phenomenology of RR

+ wrt meaning making ~ spirituality

left side | RR | right side
--- | --- | ---
problem solving | | complexification -->
insight | | self-transcendence
categorization | |  self-deception
demonstrative reference (FINsting) | | connectedness
consciousness | SOC in SWN | perspectival/participatory knowing -->
procedural knowing
working memory | transjective, evolving, involving | caring, significance
(g) / GI | optimization of connectedness & fittedness | HSC
inference | | fundamental framing of reality --> level of agent-arena
(participatory)
communication | |

+ SOC: self-organizing criticality
+ SWN: small world networks

### How RR is spiritual

+ right side of the above table

#### Fundamental Framing of Reality

+ primordiality (Heidegger)
+ pre-conceptual: below the level of propositional processing
    + concept <-- categorization <-- RR <-- demonstrative reference
    + demonstrative reference: pre-conceptual RR
+ pre-propositional
    + belief: assertion of propositions and their implications
    + not just a bottom-up process: beliefs/concepts feed back down
    + but __belief is an effect of RR__
+ pre-inferential
+ pre-communication
    + you can't learn it from other people, because learning presupposes it
    + you can refine it by other people
    + paying attention to you mother,
        + and picking up how she is communicating with you,
        + and make inferences from that, start categorizing the world
        + __presupposes__ RR
+ pre-experiential
    + meaningfully structured experience; the level of common sense
obviousness is a result of it
    + not generated by common sense obvious meaningful world
    + the common sense world is generated by RR being coupled to the env
+ pre-egoic
    + agency-arena co-emerge from RR
    + by the time you have ego in a common sense world RR has done its work
+ pre-normative:
    + primordial normativity
    + before you can assess truth, things have to be meaningful to you
    + before you can assess beauty, things have to aspectualized for you
    + before you can assess goodness, you have to have agency and arena
    + RR makes possible normative judgements of *true*, *good*, *beautiful*

### Religio

+ right side of the table
+ binding together your cognition, agency and caring
+ spirit is deeper than ego/conceptualization/normativity, primordial
    + "the way that can be spoken of is not the way"
    + fundamental grounding of your (being == your being connected)
+ the RR machinery captures a lot of spirituality
+ part of it conscious, part of it unconscious, part of it is how
cognition and consciousness are connected to the world
+ religio etymology: re+legere (re-read, read back)
    + meaning: to bind together, to connect
    + plus the fundamental framing of RR
    + spiritual sense: pre/post-egoic binding that grounds the self
and its world

Paul Acosta: A Secular Wonder:

+ wonder pointing to opening up, connectedness,
perspectival/participatory, caring, HSC
+ things always matter to us (~RR)
+ we are immersed in a bubble of meaningfulness / atmosphere of significance
    + global container
    + rhythm of breathing
    + light reflection
    + to which a living being must attune adjust herself (participatory knowing)
+ import, that we do not create from scratch
+ having a world is not a focused relationship with a clear-cut object
(not a focal object that we can objectify with an *I-it*
conceptualization)
    + but in the emergence of a bubble of significance that for
sentient being is the same as the the atmosphere to the Earth (you
participate in the atmosphere: you emerge from it and contribute to
it)
    + it creates special conditions of life where existentially
crucial distinctions between inside and outside are drawn (primordial
ground makes possible the distinction between inner and outer)
        + (transjectivity is deeper than subjectivity and objectivity)
+ as we are not aware of the atmosphere in a perceptually focalized
way, we experience it through non-focal ways such as
    + wonder, awe (& absurdity, horror)

#### Wonder

+ wonder is a state in which we become aware in a
participatory/perspectical way of the significance and our involvement
in the atmosphere of RR
+ *God* in wh om we live/move and have our being (St Paul) ~ *atmosphere*
+ in wonder/awe we disclose the RR and its spiritual significance to us
+ R. Fuller: emotion to spirituality
    1. wonder is responsible  for our deepest experiences (religio)
    2. functionality of wonder:
        + wonder: being mode vs curiosity: having mode
            + wonder/awe: opening up, non-focal; participate in the gestalt
                + comb explosion of reality & adaptivity of RR
                + remembering your being (sati)
            + curiosity: solving a problem, has a focal object;
+ wonder: sense of DA'ATH: participating in the ongoing course of the world
    + not as a story
+ wonder -- awe -- accommodation (opening up, self-transforming to
contact sth, eg. in love)
    + in the being mode --> confronting a mystery
        + insight goes from a re-framing to a trans-framing
(sensibility transcendence)
             + insight from a focal object to a way of framing
             + disclosing the machinery of religio
        + similar to flow: deeply meaningful (both in a pos and neg way)

#### Phenomenological mystery vs theoretical inexplainability

+ phenom. mytery != sth we cannot explain
    + perspectival != propositional
+ eg. it is phenomenologically impossible to know what it is like to
be dead (no framing possible perspectively)
    + but death exists
+ I can never make a focal object of my framing my capacity for RR
(perspectively)
+ whenever I'm thinking/doing/speaking I'm inside the frame (otherwise
comb explosion)
+ frame is inside the framing (recursively)
    + can't have the framing as a focal object: it is a phenom. mystery
    + eg. `I - me`
        + aspect of *me* that *I* can bring into view; what's not
there is what is generating that image
        + step back, go deeper infinitely
        + *I* can never see the *I*, *I* always see the means of the *I*
        + but: I'm not unaware of it: subsidiary awareness: not
inaccessible, but cannot focalize it
        + I'm always aware through my *I* of *me*
        + I'm always aware through my framing of my frame(d)
+ the process of __RR is phenom. mysterious__
    + but we can talk about it theoretically
+ RR grounds subjectivity and objectivity
    + RR is transjective
    + cannot use grammar of subject and object when talking about/exemplify RR;
        + only pointing to it
+ properties of a theory != properties of the object of the theory
    + the theory does not gave to exemplify what it is talking about
(eg. theory of vagueness should not be vague)
+ cannot bridge between perspectival and propositional knowings

> But the mystery opens up an affordance of trans-framing that allows us to participate in perspectively that kind of wonder/awe of religio.

+ like a transjective trajectory flow state; where we celebrate our
participation in religio
    + --> in order to enhance our agency, the disclosure of the world
and our connectedness to it

#### Sacred vs Sacredness

> What's missing from religio and can be found in religion is to confront the sacred.

+ (eg. dao and sunyata are sacred, but not divine)
+ F. Schleiermacher: distinction between:

The Sacred | Sacredness
--- | ---
metaphysical proposal of sacredness | *psycho-existential* proposal of experiencing sacredness
Western proposal: supernatural | ?
scientific revolution disreputes it |

+ *psychological* as cognitive processing, kinds of knowing, embedded, embodied,
+ *existential* as modal (being mode), transjectivity, primordiality

Sacredness as psycho-existential machinery:

+ Geertz, B. Walsh:
    + domicide: deep loneliness and homesickness
    + sacredness: homing us into the world, the world homes around us
    + __function of sacredness__: meta-meaning
        + our meaning systems (moral, legal, fashion) are dependent on
the agent-arena relationship
        + eg. if you do not participate in a new culture, none of the
meaning systems make sense
        + meta-meaning process protects us from domicide (homing us
against horror, alienation, absurdity, anxiety)
            + gives us psychotechs to get involved in serious play
            + spiritual path/communities make us more resilient in the
face of tragedies (functionality of religion)
        + **worldview attunement**: protect us from horror
+ criticism of Geertz:
    + sacredness cannot be reduced to *worldview attunement*
        + necessary but not sufficient feature
+ response to the Hellenistic domicide
    + stoicism
    + gnosticism:
        + awaken us to the primordiality of religio
        + trans-framing is transgressive: overturn the grammar of a worldview
+ Otto (<-- Kant): **numinous**
    + (instead of holy: etymology: whole, health, glory)
    + fundamental experience

Next up:

> To experience the numinous is to experience the transgressive side of sacredness.

+ how it opens us up to to wonder and awe, and takes us to the horizon of horror
