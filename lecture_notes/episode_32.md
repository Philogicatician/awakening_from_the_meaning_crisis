# Episode 32 - RR in the Brain, Insight, and Consciousness

## Recap

+ convergence argument for RR
+ RR is unified phenomena ~ GI
+ naturalistic account of RR
+ explain central features of human spirituality
    + nature of RR is the ongoing fittedness of the sensory-motor loop to its env under the logistical constraints of efficiency (compression/integration/assimilation) amd resiliency (particularization/differentiation/accommodation), complexification happens, and
    + self-transcendence emerges out of the ongoing complexification of a self-organizing system

## Naturalistic account of RR in the brain

#### Caveats:

+ no comprehensive account
+ exemplary argument of a plausible naturalistic account
    + prev episode: information processing
+ simplistic reduction (e table is just its atomsg) to the brain

### Suggestive evidence for RR and brain processing

> compression/integration/assimilation vs particularization/differentiation/accommodation

+ scale invariant processing
+ dynamic processing

#### Self Organizing Criticality (SOC) - how neurons are firing

+ Per Bak: sand patterns
    1. initially it's random (frictio, gravity, bouncing --> variation)
    2. sand grains organizes into a mount (low entropy)
    3. critical phase: system order is breaking down --> avalanche or collapse, if avalanche
    4. avalanche spreads out, introduces variation, change
    5. new mount forms on a bigger base, emergent capacity: much higher than previous
    6. and so on, but at any point collapse is a possibility

+ (particular kind of opponent processing); oscillating between (in milliseconds)
    + neurons firing in synchrony: compression
        + eg. recognizing a picture
    + neurons firing in asynchrony: particularization
+ neurons fire synchronously: structure together
+ then they go asynchronous (neural avalanche), variation
+ then they reconfigure into a new synchrony, new structure/fittedness
+ then into asynchrony
+ --> complexifying structural-functional organization, evolving fittedness to the env
    + doing/implementing RR
    + happening at many levels, highly recursive, dynamic fittedness

+ Thatcher at al.
    + GI ~ RR ~ SOC
    + also: GI ~ SOC
    + more flexibility in SOC --> more GI
    + not conclusive findings though, lot of controversy
+ conditional implications
    + for measuring GI: psychometric to direct measure in the brain
    + feed back to developing AI
    + spiritual project of addressing the meaning crisis

#### how neurons are wiring / networking

+ what network the neurons are forming

> networks are constrained in their functionality by the tradeoff of bioeconomics of efficiency and resiliency

3 (broad) types of networks:

1. regular network
    + same nr of edges/connections between nodes
    + all connections are short distance
    + redundancy of edges
    + most resilient: lot of damage, no node get isolated
    + very inefficient: mean path distance (MPD)
2. small world network (Milgram) (SWN)
    + optimal tradeoff between efficiency and resiliency
3. random network
    + mixture of short and long connections
    + most efficient

network type | mean path distance | efficiency | resiliency
--- | --- | --- | ---
regular | high | low | high
small world | mid/tradeoff | optimal | optimal
random | low | high | low

+ brain is generating small world networks --> highest functionality
+ GI ~ RR ~ small world networks
+ many suggestive, non-conclusive research examples
    + eg. salience network in the brain ~ small world

> Explain RR in terms of firing and wiring.

+ SOC (firing) and SWN (wiring) reinforce each other's development
+ engineering the evolving fittedness of your salience/relevance realization within your sensory-motor interaction with the world
+ RR will have a naturalistic explanation

### RR

1. convergence argument
2. promise of a naturalistic explanation:
    + firing and wiring machinery
        + naturalistic account of GI
        + naturalistic account of the functionality, maybe the phenomenology of consciousness (controversial)

#### Consciousness

+ consciousness is with correlated with GI
    + global workspace theory (GWT)
    + working memory (WM)
         + doing RR
+ consciousness correlates with SOC
    + binocular rivalry (Cosmelli et al., 2004):
    + Necker cube: oscillating between the front and back view
    + different part of the brain go into synchrony and asynchrony depending on which view you see
+ functionality of consciousness is to do RR (suggestive, not conclusive)
+ Manti et al. (2013):
    + passing in and out consciousness ~ small world network to local networks and vice versa

#### Insight

+ insight & SOC
    + Stephen and Dixon: measuring entropy in the brain when people solving an insight problem
    + entropy goes up before the insight, and drops after it --> the behavior becomes more organized
    + could be an instance of SOC
+ insight & small world network (SWN)
    + Schilling (2006)
    + a long distance relationship forms in the regular network --> SWN (lose some resiliency, but massive gain of efficiency)
    + insight is a process of optimization
        + e.g.: metaphor: two domains/regular networks into a SWN
+ SOC breaks up a regular network, and converts it into an SWN
    + increased optimization of RR
    + flash in salience: flow, alternation of consciousness/intelligence, optimization of your fittedness to the problem space
+ current hypotheses are most probably wrong, but progress is being made
    + explanation and generation (AI)


### salience landscaping

+ featurization (multiple object tracking) -->
+ foregrounding -->
+ figuration -->
+ framing/formulation -->

1. RR is the core machinery of participatory knowing
2. salience landscaping: perspectival knowing: dynamic situational awareness -->
3. opens up new affordances: affordance aviation: how to interact, skill development (procedural knowing) -->
4. (propositional knowing)

+ core of consciousness is 2., 1-3 is most of consciousness

#### 3 dimensions of salience landscape (ACT)

1. aspectuality (x) (--> representation) - togetherness, oneness/unity
2. centrality (y): how things are import-ant to you, vectored - hereness
3. temporality (z): dynamic process of ongoing evolution, timings make huge differences (kairos) - nowness

> Lot of the phenomenology of your consciousness is explained along with the functionality of your consciousness.

+ altering your state of consciousness can have an altering effect
    + reaching down to your identity (participatory)
    + up to your agency (procedural)

#### what is not RR

+ RR is not cold calculation
    + body making latent choices about what to do with its limited resources
    + aspect of caring
        + Heidegger: at the core of our being in the world is our foundational kind of caring
            + being in the world is inherently transjective, participatory
        + Dreyfus: optimal gripping, relevance (computers cannot do it)
