# Episode 25 - The Clash

(last part of the genealogy of the meaning crisis)

## Hegel
+ rejecting Kant's "thing in itself"
+ the real is the rational, the rational is the real
+ reality is a pattern of intelligibility, nothing beyond that
+ ideas developing/realized ~ reality developing

### Dialectic of ideas (thesis-antithesis-synthesis)
+ Plato's anagoge != dialectic
+ living system of intelligibility in development: Geist
+ ideas: patterns of intelligibility in which reality is realized: being known & actual
+ process in which ideas

0. idea
1. differentiate, oppose
2. integration
3. start 2. from 0.

+ --> complexification; irrationality is transmuted in the end
+ --> culmination: absolute geist (that known this process, self-reflective)
+ development of rationality is the development of reality itself:
    + co-development of meaning & being --> aboulute Geist: non-religious God
+ translating religious experience into philosophical structure
+ advocation of new and greatest mythology
    + secularization of the trinity
    + self-realization of rationality
    
### Criticism

+ Schopenhauer
    + missing will to live
+ Kirkegard: missing
    * anagoge,
    * PP knowing,
    * ethical/existential self-transcendence (not just epistemological),
    * personal transformation, transformative experience
+ Marx
    + history is driven by the monster (not by reason)
    + religion is a projection of our humanity, not the arena where spirituality is working itself out (Feuerbach); distract us from spirituality and history
          + rejects the theistic/idealistic resonances
          --> dialectic is one of socio-economic forces, class conflict as historical process
          + they are resolved at the end
          + secularized model of the promise land
    + participatory knowing: participating/identifying in our class/struggle
    + violent participation in
     --> pseudo-religious ideology: secularized socio-economic ideologies in conflict:
          + the political arena is where ideas, meaning is made

## Commercialism
After the bubonic plague.

## Nationalism (19th century)

+ nation state takes the role of God
+ wedded with scientific, industrial power
+ --> Imperialism

### Germany:
+ united after Bismarck
+ political power, production
+ <--> France, England, the empires

## WWI
- crashing disaster instead of the utopia
- devastating losses of lives
- Germany defeated, traumatized
     - weakened economically
     - collapse of German ideology
     + heritage:
          + Luther: anti-semitism; worshippers of the God of the Old Testament
          + mystics, gnostic undercurrent, nightmare ("in our blood", evil overloads)
          + scientific materialism
          + marxism rising
          + decadent romanticism
          + protestant reformation --> fragmentation
          + will to power
          + philosophical vacuum (after idealism and romanticism)
          + racist interpretation of history (<-- dialectics: idealism, marxism)
+ --> "autodidactic vortex of Hitler's mind"
+ --> fever pitch in the Weimar Republic

#### Hitler ~ Luther
+ personal struggle as all of Germany's, personal mythology
+ "master race"

## Rise of pseudo religious ideologies, totalitarian proposals

+ Nazism <-- response to the meaning crisis
    + history of race
    + will to power
    + gnostic nightmare
    + confuses mysticism and nationalism, decadent romanticism
    + imperialistic racism
    + tsunami off bullshit: loss/collapse of orders (NNN)
    + socio-cultural process & plus socio-economic collapse of the great depression
+ Marxism
    + opposing Nazism
    + history of class
    
Both ideologies collapse, and exacerbate the meaning crisis.

## WWII
+ titanic struggle of the Eastern front: Nazism vs Marxism
    + 1943, Kursk - biggest battle ever, technology of mass destruction
         + Russian victory
    + symptomatic of the meaning crisis
         + fixated totalitarian ideologies/beliefs
         + secular alternative of religion
         + explain history, reality and how to achieve utopia
         + mythology confused with politics
         + politicization of meaning making
               + perspectival knowing: your political viewpoint
               + participatory knowing: political identification

## Meta crisis (ecological, mental health, spiritual, existential) - Thomas Björkman:
+ need comprehensive change:
    + consciousness, cognition, character, culture - used to be provided by religion
+ alternatives (14-19 centuries): pseudo-religious ideologies clashing each other
+ return to religion, ignore scientific rev --> fundamentalism (atheism as well) --> politication --> terrorism
     + fragmented
     + auto-didactic
<-- social media facilitates
+ looking for a solution, but reject
      + religion
      + pseudo-religious ideologies
+ --> we need a religion that is not a religion (RTNAR), god beyond all gods
+ cannot deal with the meaning crisis as a political problem: misrepresentation, no political solution
+ we are locked into the dilemma of RTNAR
     + e.g. Moby Dick ??
     + zombie mythology

Moving from the historical analysis of the genealogy of the meaning crisis (collapse of orders (NNN), dilemma)
--> turning to: cognitive machinery of meaning making

## CogSci of the meaning crisis
+ to recover and salvage the axial legacy without utopian ideologies
+ engineering of psychotechs, and practices of self-transcendence --> affording the means to begin the process (individually & collectively) of bringing back:
    + connectedness lost in the 3 orders (NNN)
    + (lost ways of knowing (PPP))
    + sapiential pursuit of self-transcendence

### Mind: organ of cognition --> understand it with cogsci

Levels of reality (analysis) | Discipline (different methods, experiments)
--- | ---
brain | neuro-science
information processing | computer science, ML, AI, AGI
behavior | psychology
language, communication | linguistics
culture | anthropology

- mind is equivocal (többértelmű)
- science is fragmenting --> fragmenting who you are
- levels causally interact
- --> need for theoretical integration
- --> potential to the fragmentation of the mind
- --> philosophy: bridge between ontologies, disciplines
- --> cogsci to the rescue
