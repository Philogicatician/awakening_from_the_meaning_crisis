# Episode 13 - Buddhism and Parasitic Processing

## Recap

+ cogsci exploration of HSC
    + description: psychological, info processing, neurosci
        + flow of optimal gripping
            + exaptation of cognitive processing (fluency --> insight --> flow --> HSC)
        + optimization of cognitive processes/performance
            + tradeoff between variation and overfitting
            + by introducing noise/disruption
    + prescription/justification for the transformation of life
        + HSC are highly plausible
+ HSC do not give us propositional knowledge
    + they optimize some of our core cognitive processing
    + give us wisdom

## Interpretation of Buddhism in the West

+ Stephen Bachelor: interpretation crisis in understanding Buddhism; two positions:
    1. interpretation from within the tradition
        + pro: participatory knowing: agent-arena relationship
        + contra: myopic view, no criticism, too subjective, bias
    2. interpretation from outside the tradition
        + pro: critical objectivity
        + contra: truth vs relevance (~Socrates's problem); fixated in beliefs
             + fixated on a set of beliefs
             + belief system != faith;
             + but belief == faith is deeply in our cognitive grammar (post-Christian thinking)
    + we have to transcend bot 1. and 2.:
        + find transformatively relevant truths
+ wee need to interpret Buddhism in a way that it is relevant to issues of meaning in life
    + interpretation crisis is interaction with the meaning crisis
    + we have to recover (the axial legacy of) how we cultivate wisdom and enhanced meaning in life

#### Beliefs and Transformation

+ reduction of transformation process
+ transformation process != possession and assertion of beliefs
     + there are hytoric reasons why we got there though discussed throughout the historical part of the series
+ belief systems (ideologies) attempt to create meaning, but fail to do so
    + meaning making machinery is not at the level of propositional knowledge

### Existential Interpretation of Buddhism

+ existential: in term of the being/having modes
+ Four Noble Truths
    + not claims or beliefs; not at the propositional level
    + need to transform our states of consciousness --> perspectival level
    + need to transform the fundamental machinery of the self, the agent-arena relationship, the modes of existence --> participatory level
    + goal: not to believe them, but help you re-enact the Buddha's enlightenment process
    + alternative translations:
        + Four Ennobling Truths (SB)
        + Four Ennobling Provocations (JV)
            + refers more to affording self-transcendence

## After Awakening of the Buddha: The Four Noble/Ennobling Truths/Provocations

+ Statement: standard vs alternative representation
+ no metaphysical interpretations

### 1. All (of life) is suffering.

+ all of life cannot be suffering/pain, because suffering/pain is a comparative term
    + rather: *all is threatened by* ...
+ *suffering*
    + normally interpreted as pain/distress
    + original meaning: insane
    + became synonym with mad --> angry
         + extreme anger can render you temporarily insane/mad
         + anger is a cause of madness
    + literal meaning: undergo. lose agency, lose control of yourself
         + eg. suffer joy/pleasure
         + pain is disruptive, causing damage --> we also lose agency
    + most of the Buddha's metaphors are entrapment metaphors:
         + losing freedom, losing agency
    + the Buddha's teaching has the taste freedom,
         + no matter where you dip into it (like ocean has the taste of salt everywhere)

Reformulation: 

> Realize that all of your life is threatened with the possibility of losing freedom.

+ **dukkha**
    + etymology: a wheel whose center is not properly attached to the axes, so the wheel destroy itself while turning
    + self-destructiveness (--> losing agency)
+ all of your life is threatened by self-destructive/deceptive behavior

#### Parasitic Processing & Reciprocal Narrowing

> The very processes that make you adaptively intelligent, also make you vulnerable to self-deceptive/destructive behavior.

1. interpreting an event as *bad*
2. brain is trying to predict similar events in the future
    + adaptive
    + brain is assessing the probability of another similar event happening
        + the amount of all probable events is infinitely vast <-- would need to track all possible variables for it
        + the brain uses __heuristics__ to cut through the combinatorial explosion, and to zero in on the relevant info:
            1. **representativeness heuristics**: judging the probability of an event by judgint how salient it is
            2. **availability heuristic**: judging the probability of an event by how easy it is to remember a similar event occurring
3. being in a *bad* state triggers **encoding specificity**
    + when you are sad, it is difficult to remember happy events, and easy to remember sad events
    + memory stores the facts & perspectival/participatory aspects of them together (the state you were in)
    + experiment: people learning a set of words perform better on the test when the test is in the same room
    + the brain doesn't just store info, but also stores how you were fitted to the environment/context
        + adaptive

+ you are in a bad state -->
    + it is easy for you to remember bad things: you judge bad things happening with higher prob (availability heuristic)
    + as the bad thing just happened, it is more salient; you judge the prob of bad things happening higher (representativeness heuristic)
    + the two heuristics are reinforcing each other & encoding specificity -->
        + you start to use the adaptive strategy of **confirmation bias**: looking for info that support your current beliefs
    + you judge the prob of a bad event high
+ we misjudge probs because of these heuristics
    + but we can't do without them (see hyperbolic discounting), they are adaptive
+ the above is an automatic, self-organizing process
    + cognition needs to be self-organizing to deal with the vast amount of possibilities:
        + simultaneously bottom-up and top-down (eg. reading)
    + need to use heuristics
    + complexifying process with emergent abilities

1. event interpreted as bad
2. high prob of bad thing increases
     + availability & representativeness heuristics & wncoding specificity
     + --> leads to confirmation bias
3. you get anxious
4. anxiety makes you lose cognitive flexibility: framing becomes rigid, narrow -->
5. problem solving ability goes down -->
6. more mistakes, fails -->
7. increased anxiety -->
8. reinforcing, feeding 1-7.
9. you get fatalistic: "I'm doomed."

+ you *know* (propositionally) when you are in this downward spiral
+ complex, self-organizing system
    + when intervening in one place, the rest of the system re-organizing itself around
    + <-- the system adapts and tries to preserve itself,
    + to protect you from (self-)destruction
+ this self-organizing self-deception/destruction is a perennial threat

Addiction as parasitic processing:

+ Mark Lewis: Memoirs of an Addicted Brain
     + standard model of addiction is wrong:
          + chemical dependency
          + compulsive desire
+ addiction is a loss of agency --> the addicted person becomes dysfunctional
+ reciprocal narrowing:
    + agent-arena co-identify
    + losing cognitive flexibility, nr of options start to decline
    + --> the variability of agency gets narrower
    + perspectively/participatory learned loss of agency
+ this is always a threat to us, because it's endemic, self-organizing, adaptive:
     + self-denial is not a solution: you cannot hop over your shadow
+ but: there must be a spiral up: anagoge

### 2. Suffering is caused by desire.

Reformulation:

> Realize that dukkha is caused by attachment.

+ in the sense of narrowing and loss of agency

### 3. The cessation of suffering is attainable.

Reformulation:

> Realize that you can recover your agency.

+ stopping the reciprocal narrowing by using the same machinery:
    + through anagoge, spiral up
     + by reducing capacity for self-deception
+ starting to enact enlightenment
+ the Buddha's psychotechs of practices:
    + how to deal with a complex dynamical system that is operating against you
    + by cultivating a counter-active dynamical system that is operating for you
        + not just random interventions, single efforts
        + operating at the states of consciousness and traits of character

#### Eightfold path

> A counteractive dynamical system that counteracts parasitic processing and does reciprocal opening.

+ beyond the ego and everyday world
+ represented by an eight-spoked wheel:
    + self organizing system that rolls itself
    + parts are interconnected
    + ethical, existential, sapential aspects

1. Right understanding - cognition
2. Right thinking/aspiration - cognition
3. Right speech - character
4. Right action - character
5. Right livelihood - character
6. Right effort - character
7. Right mindfulness - consciousness
8. Right concentration - consciousness

+ right is not moral, but getting an optimal grip
    + right vs bad concentration
+ reverses reciprocal narrowing to take you to anagogic awakening
+ helps in modal confusion
+ opens you up to self-transcendence
