# Episode 22 - Descartes vs. Hobbes

2 grammars opposing each other:

+ Luther: *consci*ence
+ Descartes: *consci*ousness
+ intersect: individual mind

## Descartes (D) vs Hobbes (H)

Letter exchanges on reasoning, rationality:

+ H: let's build a material machine for computation --> cognition (no soul, no specialness/uniqueness)
+ D: rejects materialism
    + claims of the scientific revolution:
    + matter is real
    + reality is mathematically measured
    + meaning and value of things is not in themselves
        + reasoning vs computation
            + goal/care/standard of reasoning: truth (acting on purpose)
        + normative: what is ought
    + truth depends on meaning      
        + rationality is Cartesian
    + (rationality in human reasoning: difficult to integrate rationality with scientific materialism;
        + behaving logically to get certainty in our truths
        + criticism of rationality by Descartes himself)
    + normativity, meaning, purpose are central to reasoning
    + matter is inert, has no purpose, no meaning
		+ cannot have a material reasoner
    + science deals with how things are, not what ought, no normative structures
    + cannot get purpose and meaning out of matter: abacus, putting a sentence together: `cat on the mat`
+ D: no intrinsic meaning in material marks 
    + --> they only have meaning because they are associated with ideas in your mind; ideas possess meaning;
    + --> H's view on matter makes rationality problematic
+ rationality is not just the logical manipulation of propositions
+ rationality cares about meaning and normative standards
+ --> the notion of rationality is mysterious nowadays

## Descartes vs Hobbes - part II

+ Descartes: Galileo: math is the language of reality (Plato)
    + primary properties: measurable, in the object - objective - matter
    + secondary qualities: qualia. pain, beauty (only exist in the mind) - subjective - mind
+ qualia are central to consciousness
+ matter does not possess qualia, there is no way to generate qualia or consciousness from matter
+ AI does not possess consciousness
+ the mind is isolated, trapped inside itself
+ doubt of everything
+ certainty:
    1. logical notion: deductive validity
    2. psychological notion: inability of doubt (eg. radical bigot)
    + --> D pushes 2. to the extreme, even doubting math
    + cannot doubt that he exists: in order to be subject to illusion, his mind must exists
    + --> "cogito ergo sum" (statement not argument): `1. == 2.`
    + mind is only consciousness (mind touching itself), nothing else
        + I know I am conscious by being conscious
        + matter does not have that

#### AI

+ weak: important, but does not advance our scientific understanding
+ strong: AGI: computer as an instance of mind, consciousness
+ how do we know if it succeeded ? 
    + --> I can refute D's objections (purpose, meaning consciousness, normativity, contact with realness)
    + open question

Problem with Descartes' solution: existential cost

+ mind and matter are different, they share no properties
    + mind: purpose, truth, qualia, contact with itself
    + matter: space and time, force, energy transfer
    + BUT: how mind and matter causally interact
    + mind making matter change and vice versa
    + mind and matter are constantly interacting
    + D's makes the mind-matter/mind interaction impossible
    + --> you are cut off from yourself, taste of water is absurd
    + mind-mind interaction is impossible (paying attention of other body), how do I know other minds are not automaton

Dichotomy of realness (unstable grammar):

+ math --> is real --> **empiricism**
+ **positivism**: how do you know you are not dreaming
+ mind touching itself --> consciousness --> real --> rationality
+ romantics --> how are you in touch with the word 
+ --> back and forth, ad-hominem arguments (insults) 

Loss of contact with tradition, body, other minds, world.
Do I still have contact with my own mind ?

+ historical notions of self are false
+ introspections/memories are false
+ --> logical consequence: only contact is: this moment of contactless, isolated self-awareness
+ --> meaning crisis

## Pascal (P) vs Descartes (D)

+ P has a transformative experience (religious)
+ spirit of geometry/math - we have this, Descartes
+ spirit of finesse - we lost it (jazz, kissing, tai chi), being - lost it
    * procedural: knowing how  
    * perspectival: knowing what it's like
    * participatory: knowing mutual transformation, reciprocal revelation
    * we lost the possibility of transformative truth/knowing
    * we don't believe in self-transcendence (<-- Luther)
    * we don't need self-transformation to be in contact with reality --> only math, computation

We face environmental, economic, socio-political crises, culture wars.
