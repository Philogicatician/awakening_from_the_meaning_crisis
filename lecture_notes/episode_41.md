# Episode 41 - What Is Rationality?

## Recap

+ association of wisdom with meaning
    + pursuing the cogsci of wisdom
+ association of wisdom with the cultivation of enlightenment
    + response to PPs
    + response to the historical forces with cogsci
+ McGee & Barber convergence argument
    + core of wisdom is the `systematic seeing through illusion and into what's
        real`
+ wisdom is
    + *how* not *what* you know
    + *process* not the *product* of knowing
    + *interpreting* not *describing* knowledge
    + perspectival, participatory
+ Stanovich: bridge to rationality
    + core of rationality is the valuing the process of cognition
    + reliable and systematic overcoming of self-deception
    + optimization of processing to achieve our goals --> affording flourishing
        + during optimization we might change our goals
            + as we start to appreciate more the process rather than the end
                result

## The Rationality Debate

+ people acknowledge the authority of standards/principles of reasoning
+ people reliably fail to meet/apply these standards in experiments
+ interpretation 1: most people are irrational in nature
    + but: rationality is *existential*, not abstract theoretical
        + rationality has implications on people's
            political/legal/moral/developmental status

### Cohen

> Argument that people are rational.

+ people cannot be comprehensively irrational
+ competence vs performance
+ the standards come from us
    + the source of our normative theory is us
        + idealizing all our performance errors through time and reflection
        + getting to the underlying competence
+ at the level of our competence we are rational
    + all errors are performance errors

### Stanovich & West (2000) vs Cohen

+ competence vs performance distinction (Chomsky, Piaget)
+ competence:
    + the child's errors are *systematic*
        + their competence is not yet developed
+ performance errors are not systematic, but circumstantial
+ the errors made in the experiments are *systematic*
    + systematic errors: one error predicts the other
    + eg. failure in *critical detachment* - choosing bad args for my beliefs - predicts
        + *belief perseverance* - suicide notes
        + *leaping to the wrong conclusion* - lily pads
+ the errors are competence errors
+ but: Cohen's argument that we are the source of our standards is right
+ but: there is an assumption/hidden premise about competence in Cohen's argument
    + competence is *single*, *static* and *individualistic*
        + single
            + Plato: there are 3 competences (man, lion, monster) inside humans
                helping them achieve their goals, correct their errors
            + these competences conflict with each other
            + `rationality != syllogistic reasoning`
        + static
            + as the child's competence is developing
            + the adult's competence is also inherently dynamic & developmental
+ competences *are*
    + multiple
    + in an ongoing development
+ we have **dual-processing** models
    + (Plato: man-lion-monster)
    + different styles/ways of processing info that are good for different
        kinds of problem solving
    + in a complementary (opponent processing) relationship

### Cherniak

> Argument that people are rational.

+ the difficulty is at the level of our competence
+ `ought implies can` - are we applying the right normative theory to people in
    the experiments ?
+ **finitary predicament**
    + we cannot invoke all of our implications/assumptions:
        + it is *combinatorially explosive*
    + we cannot be algorithmic / comprehensively deductively logical
        + *certainty* and completeness cannot be standards
        + that is cognitive suicide
+ we also cannot choose/check inference/representation/contradiction *arbitrarily*
+ we check/pick the *relevant* contradictions/implications/representations
    + by doing RR
+ if we try to apply formal logic comprehensively in our lives (as rationality is *existential*)
    + the *finitary predicament* sets us up for failure
+ scientist in the experiments are using formal logic/probability theory
    + (prob theory is also formal/algorithmic)
    + these theories can only be applied in limited contexts
    + an *ought* that we cannot possibly meet
        + is the *wrong* normative theory
+ `rationality != logic`
    + rather to know *when/where/to what degree* use logic/probability

### Stanovich & West vs Cherniak

+ Cherniak is talking about *intelligence*, not *rationality*
    + *computational limitations* (`== RR`) are about intelligence
+ `foolish = highly intelligent + highly irrational`
    + "processes that make you intelligent are the processes that make you
        subject to self-deception"

#### Testing for Intelligence/Working Memory vs for Rationality

+ testing for *computational limitations* (zeroing in on relevant info: RR)
    + measuring `g()`, `G`
    + strong positive manifold
+ testing for rationality/reasoning
    + measuring general factor of reasoning: `g(r)`
    + strong positive manifold
+ correlation between `g()` and `g(r)`: `r = 0.3`
    + intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient factor in rationality

#### What is rationality then ?

```
rationality != logic
rationality != intelligence
```

What is the missing piece for rationality ?
What is understanding ?

### Smedslund (1970)

> Argument that people are rational.

+ problem is with the *interpretation* of the tasks in the experiments
    + you cannot experiment your way out of interpretation
        + interpretation is always needed
        + theoretical debate is unavoidable

#### Fallacy vs Misunderstanding

__Fallacy__:

1. interpreting/understanding the problem correctly
2. reasoning incorrectly
3. giving the wrong answer

__Misunderstanding__:

1. interpreting/understanding the problem incorrectly
2. reasoning correctly
3. giving the wrong answer

If we want to conclude that people are *irrational*, we have to attribute to them
*fallacious cognition/reasoning*.

+ (some people avoid self-criticism of having reasoned incorrectly by claiming that they are being misunderstood)
    + (equivocating/trading on)
+ but: the attribution of fallacy and attribution of misunderstanding are not
    *independent*
    + cannot interpret the experimental results just misunderstanding or
        fallacy

#### (Preliminary) Account of Understanding

Conditions of understanding:

1. x --> identical to x
2. x --> contradicts x
3. x --> x implies
4. x --> relevant to x
5. (x --> what is x relevant to)

+ to know if someone has understood us is to determine whether they have:
    + drawn the same identities
    + drawn the same contradictions
    + drawn the same implications
    + (excluding 4-5.)
+ somebody *understands* us, if they reason the way we do

#### Pragmatic Contradiction

1. if the participants *understood* the problem,
    2. they *reasoned* the same way as the scientists did,
3. but if they *reasoned* the same while *understanding*,
    4. they could have *reasoned* the same while solving the problem
        + this is a __pragmatic contradiction__

+ *fallacy* seems the wrong interpretation of the experiments

1. as participants are consistently producing the wrong answer,
    2. that could be an evidence of problem *misunderstanding*
    3. but that means that they are *reasoning poorly*

+ or: the problem was miscommunicated

### Stanovich & West vs Smedslund

+ they have not read Smedslund, but use his arguments
+ convergent argument with the one against Cohen:
    + need a normativity on *problem formulation/construal*

#### Normativity of Construal

+ **construal**: problem formulation
    + how people interpret/make sense of the situation of the problem
+ independent *normativity* from the *problem solving/inferential normativity*
    + in order to break out of the pragmatic contradiction circle
+ this is a *non-inferential* aspect of rationality
    + understanding/construal is non-inferential
        + __relevance is pre-inferential__
+ RR plays a huge role in problem formulation

__Proposal__:

+ for the *normativity of problem formulation*:
    + __bad problem formulation__:
        + puts you in a combinatorially explosive search space
        + not turning ill-defined problems into well-defined problems
        + salience is misleading you
    + __good problem formulation__:
        + *insight problem solving*

+ *insight* is crucial/central to rationality
    + coming from the *non-inferential* part of the psyche
+ `rationality = inference + problem solving with RR + insight`
    + overlapping with *wisdom*
    + the many competences involved in rationality
+ but the issue of *construal* doesn't play a big role in Stanovich' theory of
    rationality

#### Theory of Rationality

+ `intelligence != rationality`
    + intelligence is not predictive of rationality
    + correlation between `g()` and `g(r)` is 0.3
+ missing piece: what accounts for most of the variance then ?
    + appropriate *cognitive style*
    + *bad mindware*/inappropriate psychotech

__Cognitive style__:

+ to learn a set of sensitivities and skills
+ the *cognitive style* most predictive of rationality (doing well on the
    reasoning task):
    + *Active Open-mindedness* (Baron)
        + Stoicism, cognitive behavioral therapy
        + training yourself to look for patterns of self-deception/biases
            + eg. confirmation/essentialism/availability bias
        + sensitize myself to look for biases in my day-to-day cognition
            + and actively counteract them
                + asking others to help (individualistic assumption of
                    competence weakens)
                + internalize it
        + do not overdo it:
            + choking in comb explosion
            + do it to the right degree
        + *need for cognition* predicts *active open-mindedness*
            + problem finding
                + *curiosity* for solving problems
                + *wonder*: opens you up to question your worldview
            + important because rationality is an *existential* issue
