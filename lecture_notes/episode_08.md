# Episode 08 - The Buddha and "Mindfulness"

## Recap

+ Aristotle's worldview
    + con-formity theory
    + geocentric world
    + theory of the world and being in the world are connected, and mutually supportive:
    + --> worldview attunement --> existential modes where agent and arena co-identifies
+ Siddharta Gautama's myth
    + having mode
    + being mode: becoming sth (mature, virtuous, love)
    + modal confusion: being needs satisfied by the having mode
        + becomes a vicious cycle
        + the palace is the mythological representation of being stuck in the having mode
        + market economy: selling you thing based on your political and economic identity

## Siddharta's Myth

+ leaves the palace
+ sees
    + a sick person
    + an old person
    + a corpse, dead person
    + a renuncier/mendicant with a deep peace in his eyes
        + first representation of the being mode: untouched by our mortality
+ --> having mode undermined --> existential crisis (his being is shattered, not just his beliefs)
+ returns to the palace: but cannot find peace there anymore, does not belong there anymore
    + disillusionment: losing the illusion of modal confusion
    + irreversibility after an awakening experiences
+ leaves the palace again leaving his wife and child behind
    + "the moral life sits upon sth deeper"
         + morality is meaningless if you lost meaning
         + wisdom is more than reality
         + virtue: being plugged into the cultivation of wisdom
+ goes into the forest: self-denial
    + asceticism is still the modal confusion, just the opposite pole
    + swings between self-indulgence and self-denial
    + not working: annihilating the self is still thinking about /having* a self
    + self-denial is the negation of self-indulgence not its transcendence
        + the framing stays the same
+ at the river; "the strings can't be too tight, and they can't be too loose" (<-- Aristotle: golden mean)
    + middle path: radical reformation (not average!):
        + transformation of the having both by rejecting both self-indulgence and self-denial --> optimization strategies: connectedness
+ realization:
    + saved from drowning in the river by a little girl - demeaning for a man
    + radicalness of change
    + decides to optimize his cognition to pursue the being mode the he remembers to have in the eyes of the mendicant
        + remembering **sati**: modal memory: remember a lost mode of being; what it is like to be in the being mode
        + restructuring your being
        + remember the being mode: participatory knowing
+ (sati is translated to 'mindfulness')
+ transforms the psychotechs he has learned from his teachers
    + he wants to remember/recover the being mode (not intellectually, but as his agency, and the world that is in co-identification with that agency)
    + set of psychotechs to help to remember sati
    + 'Buddha': the awaken one

Remember - Sati - **Wake Up** 
+ recover my world and identity
+ re-member: to belong again

## CogSci of Mindfulness

+ mindfulness revolution is a response to the meaning crisis
+ awakening is a response to the meaning crisis

### Re-formulation, Understanding, Cognitive Processes of Mindfulness

### Criticism of "Mindfulness"

+ definition of mindfulness: "Pay attention to the present moment in a non-judgemental fashion"

Language of teaching/training != language of explaining mindfulness 
+ language of training: imitation, involvement, presence
    + eg. memory training: method of location, mind-palace
+ language of explaining
    + eg. memory explanation: spatial metaphor/location does not work
        + blue - red (color)
        + shoe (rhyme):
        + but: red and shoe should not be close

#### Feature list of mindfulness: 

+ (paying attention / shining a spotlight  to the present moment)
+ being present
    + too relative, too simplistic - language of training
+ not judging 
    + pay attention to sth and not to distractions is a kind of judging already - language of training
+ insight
    + vipassana (existential) means insight
+ reduce reactivity, become more balanced

<-- feature list is not sufficient, we need idos/structural-functional organization (turn feature list into a feature schema)

#### Idos/feature schema of mindfulness

+ re-interpret the features to explain their functionality
+ use cogsci of attention, insight and self-regulation/control
+ ask causal and constitutive questions
+ answer how mindfulness can bring about radical transformation

Types of features

+ **states** - I can "do" these, start-stop, disrupted-reengage
    + being present
    + non judging
+ **traits** - that you cultivate, realize, results
    + insight
    + reduced reactivity

How states cause traits ?  Causal relation between features 
+ how does being present cause insight or reduce reactivity ?
+ how does non-judging cause insight or reduce reactivity ?

Part-whole relationships - constitutive questions

Being present --> causing insight (as in modal transformation) 
+ being present --> rather **right concentration**
    + paying attention
        + not too tight, not too loose for the strings
    + training:
        + concentrate on my finger vs
        + look and my finger and see the details, etc. - **soft vigilance**
            + **renew interest**: constant exploring (con-formity)
    + paying attention:
        + optimization process
        + tuning between not too tight, not too loose
        + getting involved, interested (ety. inter-esse) - participating with whatever you are paying attention to (con-form)

Refuting the attention as spotlight metaphor 
+ attention makes things more salient
+ missing how the salience optimization works, and how it is connected to insight

Attention is **cognitive unison** (Ch. Mole)
+ walk - can *do* directly
+ *practice* attention by optimizing doing sth else
    + eg. to practice chess is to optimize playing chess
+ we don't directly pay attention
    + you pay attention by optimizing another process
    + eg. optimize you seeing so that it becomes looking and watching
    + eg. optimize your hearing so that it becomes listening
+ cognitive unison is coordinating various processes to share the same goal
    + eg. optimize seeing and hearing at the same time to watch this video

> How attention gets optimized in mindfulness practices, how does it bring about systemating insight of awakening that motivates people for self-transformation to escape from modal confusion and other existential dilemmas ?
