# Episode 50 - Tillich and Barfield

## Recap

+ *sacred second self* 
+ mutual criticism of Corbin and Jung (with the help of Buber)

## Tillich

+ aware of
    + depth psychology and Jung
        + Dourley's work expands on this: dialogue/integration between Jung and Tillich
            + recovery of *non-theistic* religion
    + Heidegger
    + the *symbol* in an *imaginal* way
+ response to the MC: __The Courage to Be__
+ critical of *literalism/fundamentalism* 
    + like H's *intotheology*
    + form of **idolatry**
        + attempting to *have* rather than *become*

### Responding to the MC: Guidance on How to Live

+ resisted the Nazi's
+ existential **courage**
    + confront/overcome *meaninglessness*
    + responding to perverted responses to the MC itself (like Nazism)
+ process of **encouragement**
    + Aristotle: not just bravery, endurance
        + not just facing danger, enduring difficulty
    + *courage* is a **virtue**
        + involving *wisdom*: seeing through illusion
            + seeing through the distortion of fear/distress: what is truly good
                + *acting* accordingly

#### Seeing through/to the Depths

+ Tillich's notion of **faith**:
    + circling back to the Israelite notion of *DA'ATH*
        + participatory knowing
        + adding that in the course of being this is an aspirational process
    + not a *willful assertion*
    + **ultimate concern**
        + that which concerns us ultimately
+ __idolatry__: transforming the symbol/icon into an object/idol to *have/control/manipulate*
    + using *ultimate concern* for sth that is not *ultimate*

#### Ultimate Concern

+ caring/coping/involvement/commitment
+ perspectival/participatory/aspirational/open-ended
    + points towards the **inexhaustibleness** of the **ground of being**
+ directed to H's notion of **Dasein**
    + *dasein*: the being whose being is in question
        + coming into deeper *contact*
        + *remembering* through *alathea*
        + ontological wonder towards the ground of being/meaning

#### Notion of God

+ transgressive of classical theism
    + but: not *atheism*
+ **imaginal symbol** for the *ground of being*: **icon**
    + God symbolizes the *ground of being*, therefore __God is **no kind of thing**__
    + there s a **no-thingness** to God
+ any attempt to reify *God* as a *thing* is a form of *idolatry*

```
meaning ------- reality
          God
```

+ *God* is a simultaneous grounding of
    1. **meaning** making
    2. **reality**
    3. the **relationship** between *meaning* and *reality*
+ any attempt to limit God into any of the three components is *idolatry*
    + like literalism/fundamentalism
+ if we allow ourselves to come into **quest** in a *wondering* way;
    + if we *participate* in an *aspirational* trajectory motivated by *ultimate concern*
        + we get into a resonant relationship: Tillich's method of **correlation**

#### Correlational Method

+ ongoing **tonos** (polar tension) between
    + **existential questioning/questing**
    + **revelation**: the way the depths of reality reveal themselves
+ ongoing resonant mutual fitting: 
    + revelation *fits* into the existential questing
    + existential questing has to *fit itself*
+ not propositional theology
+ **depths of reason/psyche**
    + grounding depths of our rationality
    + standing beyond ourselves: *ek-stasis*
        + self-transcendence
        + crucial for *aspiration*
    + Platonic idea
    + RR
    + recursive machinery of rationality
    + aspirational rationality
+ **depths of reality**
+ *imaginal* **symbol** between them
    + **miracle**
        + *shining*
    + **mystery**
        + *withdrawal* into the *moreness* / comb explosive depth of reality
+ **correlational method**:
    + **anagogic** cycling between the *depths of reason* and *depths of realness*

```
depths of reason ------ symbol ------ depth of reality
       |                                    |
       |                                    |
    ek-stasis  ------ anagoge ------   miracle/mystery
```

__Symbols__

+ are more than a *sign*
+ are participatory
+ open up levels of reality/ourselves otherwise closed to us
    + in a mutually affording resonant fashion
+ are self-organizing, growing out of the *unconscious* within/out
    + not *made* by us
+ have a life cycle:
    + born and die
        + literalism/fundamentalism are inappropriate ways of trying to hold onto dying symbols
        + eg. in Christianity
+ have a surplus of meaning
    + resonating with moreness
    + numinous character grounded in the resonant depth of mind and reality
+ are *transformative/transjective/translucent*

*Correlation* is not just a propositional theology.

+ if you are not undergoing a profound transformation
    + you are not doing the *correlational method*

#### Realization of the Symbol

+ realization of the transformative power of the symbol:
    + *taking into* the symbol in your current *frame*, and *actualize* it in reality
+ __relationship__: *aspirational*

```
existential self  -------  essential self
current self  -------  sacred second self
```

+ **essential self**: self in the fullness of being
    + that is capable of recognizing the fullness of being in the world
        + through anagogic *conformity*
    + is *normatively ahead* of the **existential self**
    + is *tempting* the existential self to a better way of being
        + out of the *existential entrapment* (using gnosis)
    + is bound up with **agape** (St Paul)
        + my *salience landscape* naturally self-organizes to tempt me towards the good: **sophrosyne**

#### History of Meaninglessness

+ aspirational/transformative journey of **encouragement**
    + embodying courage
    + gets us to confront *meaninglessness*
+ the trajectory:
1. Ancient era
    + experience of meaninglessness: __finitude of being__, fear of death
        + response from the Stoics
2. Christian period
    + experience of meaninglessness: __guilt__
        + response from Lutherism
3. Current time
    + experience of meaninglessness: __despair__
        + response from existentialism of the 60ies
+ __the response to faith/DA'ATH__:
    + the *no-thingness* of God takes into itself / transforms he *nothingness* of meaninglessness/dispair

#### Aspect-Identity Shift (Vervaeke)

+ **aspect shift**, ie. Necker cube
    + the thing doesn't change, but the *aspect* flips/shifts: *aspect shift*
        + what's salient; foregrounded/backgrounded
+ **aspect-identity shift**
    + seeing/experiencing the *no-thingness* of God as the inexhaustible fount of meaning cultivation

#### Nishitani: Religion and Nothingness

+ Buddhism:
    + when we __realize/participate in/identify with__ the *no-thingness* of *sunyata*
        + we gain the competence to *aspect shift* the *nothingness* of meaninglessness
            + pointing to the ground of the inexhaustible source that can not be drained dry by *despair*
+ when we stop trying to push away *nothingness*, and develop an imaginal relationship to it, and move through it anagogically with the *no-thingness* of God
    + we overcome meaninglessness
+ Nietzsche:

> If you stare long enough to the abyss, it begins to stare back into you.

+ N did not stare long enough
    + lead him to **nihilism**

#### Epek-tasis

+ the traditional teleological model of i
    + moving towards a final destination/Promise Land
        + where I will see God, and come to rest there, having achieved my goal
+ Gregory of Nyssa's notion
    + no *resting* in God
    + infinite self-transcendence in the infinity of God
        + constant disclosure of the inexhaustibleness of the ground of being
        + transjectivity and transframing never stop
+ __etymology__:
    + *epi-*: over, on top of
    + *ek-*: out
    + *teinein*: to stretch, *tasis*: stretching, **tension**
    + *tonos* also derives from *tenein*

#### Transjectivity of the Symbol

+ symbol joins together and grounds the *subjective* and *objective*
+ Nietzsche: *will to power*
    + *will*: subjective
    + *power*: power in existence
        + the way everything is pushing/maintaining itself in existence
    + bridging between the subjective and objective
+ criticism of Jung: *individuation* is the subjective side of the symbolic relationship
    + Tillich puts it in *tonos* with *participation*

```
individuation           ---------------------        participation
     |                                                    |
     |                                                    |
neither the autonomy of reason ------- nor a heteronomous/demonic imposition of authority from without
```

+ like the process of *aspiration*: self-transcendence
    + not sth that you autonomously make,
    + nor sth recieved passively from the outside

#### Theonomous

+ **theonomous**:
    + *theo*: God
        + God as the 
            + ground of being, ongoing *epektasis* of the inexhaustible
            + affordance of the ongoing transframing
    + *nomos*: order, law
    + God ordered/governed
+ joining *reason* and *revelation*
+ connection to *Gnosticism*
    + **transgression** of theism
        + God as the *demiurge* keeping us in *existential entrapment*
+ realization of the __God beyond the God of theism__
    + resistant to fundamentalism/literalism

#### Non-theism

+ **non-theism**
    + transcends **theism** and **atheism**
    + is an appropriate way to talk about Buddhism/Taoism
    + is a rejection of presuppositions shared by theism and atheism

presupposition | theist | atheist | non-theist
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. God is the Supreme Being | yes | accepts the statement, with a *no* truth value | rejects of the statement
2. God is accessed through *belif* | yes | yes, but there is no access to be found | rejects
3. theology and anti-theology do not require transformative *anagoge* |  agrees | agrees | rejects
4. sacredness is personal or impersonal | personal | impersonal | transjective/participatory/aspirational

+ presupposition 3:
    + all you have to to is *have/possess* the *propositions* and *infer* the correct implications
+ presupposition 4:
    + atheists not having sth like sacredness functioning in their life does not sit with their performative existence

### Vervaeke's Criticism of Tillich

+ Tillich is more practical than Heidegger:
    + how to live
    + how to cultivate *courage* and *faith*
        + reinterpreted
+ but: T does not offer practices of transformation
    + as opposed to Jung, who created a(n although intra-psychic) **practice** for enacting/cultivating the *imaginal*
        + **active imagination**: to allow images to self-organize in an autopoietic fashion, so that
            + the *Self* and the *ego* can talk to each other
        + **dream interpretation**

## Barfield

+ **symbolic participation** that is translated into **practices**
+ in fellowship with the *Inklings*: Lewis Tolkien, Barfield, Williams

#### Di Fuccia: Owen Barfield: Philosophy, Poetry, and Theology

+ __influences__:
    + Gnosticism
    + Rudolf Steiner as a modern Gnostic - although still difficult to understand *why*
    + Neoplatonism through Coleridge
    + early Romantics, post-Kantians, like Schlegel
        + emphasis on the *in-finity* of reality
            + *inexhaustible moreness* constantly drawing us into self-transcendence
            + the *finite* longing for the *infinite* (Schlegel)
        + **eduction** (to draw out), *education*
                + discloses/reveals the *sacredness/transjectivity*, but never completely
                + discloses the capacity of RR to adapt to the moreness
		+ we experience/participate sacredness in **creativity** and in the flow of self-transcendence
		    + **poesis/poetry**

#### Poesis

+ *ek-stasis* in creativity: the way we stand beyond ourselves
+ transformative experience: *felt* change in consciousness
    + like the relationship of the *sacred second self* and *aspiration*
+ the poetic aspects of everyday language can re-awaken us to the *connectedness*
    + connectedness to the *inexhaustibleness* experienced as sacredness

### Evolutionary Analysis of Language

+ etymology of words
+ *pneuma* - *spiritus*, **meanings**
    1. wind
    2. spirit: self-moving aspects of the psyche
+ the *division* between the two meanings replicates the Cartesian division between *objective* and *subjective*
+ historically the two meanings had a non-logical **identity**
    + and people who used this word in its inter-affording meanings, were engaged in a form of participation
		+ the way of being *before* the Cartesian disjunction
			+ anagogic/transjective resonance with reality

#### Meaning of Words

+ Lakoff & Johnson: we use language where words have an *inner* and *outer* meaning

```
                                 attack
                                 ------


physical destructiona                         critical argumentation
"I attacked the castle."                      "He attacked my argument."
```

+ we don't feel the two meanings as radically disjunctive
+ synonymy between *see* and *understand*
    + *see*
	    1. experience visually
	    2. comprehend
	+ *understand*
	    1. stand under
	    2. comprehend
+ according to Lakoff & Johnson this is not an *evolutionary* process,
	+ but a *psychological* development within individuals
	    + starting from sensory-motor *seeing*
	    + taken up to conceptual sense of *seeing*
+ Vervaeke & Kennedy argued that the psychological development is deeper than represented in Lakoff & Johnson
    + missing *top-down* aspect (influence of Corbin)
		+ *abstract sensory* and *concrete sensory* meet together in the **imaginal**
		+ this is why two very different sensory-motor actions (standing under and seeing) can mean the same
+ cognitive re-exaptation (circuit reuse) of of the imaginal symbol
    + poesis
    + *idolatry*/literalism: forget the *justice* and focus on *having* balance
		+ losing the iconic seeing through, and only look at the concrete

#### Meaning Crisis

+ Barfield: The Rediscovery of Meaning
+ we had *participation* and then the *division*
    + two-word mythology: everything is separated: *inner* and *outer* being
    + and then the meaning crisis
+ we have to move towards a *final participation*
    + as a response to the MC
	+ recovery of participation integrated within the gains of rational sciences
	    + recovery of the perspectival/participatory

#### Criticism

+ we also need a *science* of meaning cultivation
    + how does the perspectival/participatory fit into our scientific processes

#### Praise

+ Heidegger taking from Eckhart and Luther:
    + *gelesenheit*: *letting* the rose *be* (complete passivity)
		+ overcompensating for Descartes' notion of complete activity of mind
+ Heidegger forgets *dirtbrook* (breakthrough) in Eckhart
    + *breakthrough*: attentional scaling:
		+ breaking through the inappropriate framing
		+ making a new frame
+ Barfield's notion of poesis/creativity as participatory
    + *synergistic*: non-theist God plays the leading role, but we contribute
		+ i.e. *DA'ATH*
		    + we are not passive recipients of history
		    + nor are we its complete authors
		    + **we participate**

## Parting Words

+ scientific accounti/framework of RR can be put into a discourse/dialogue with:
	+ spirituality
	+ symbolism
	+ sacredness
	+ prophets of the MC
	    + and afford critical & creative dialogue between them
		+ and afford a potential synoptic integration
+ this is what it means to **awaken from the meaning crisis**
