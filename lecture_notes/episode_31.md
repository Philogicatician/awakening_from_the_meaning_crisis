# Episode 31 - Embodied-Embedded RR as Dynamical-Developmental GI

## Theory of RR

#### R: lack of systematic import --> no sci theo is possible

#### RR: sci theory is possible

+ analogy: theo of evolution by natural selection
     + virtual engine that regulates the reproductive cycle, so that the system veloves the biological fittedness of the organism to the constantly changing env
     + virtual engine in the embodied/embedded brain that regulates the sensory-motor loop so that the cognitive-interactional fittedness is constantly evolving to fit/deal with the constantly changing env
     + need a system of constraints to zero in on the relevant info
         + selective (efficiency)
         + enabling (resiliency)
+ self-organization operates in a multi-scalar way
+ self-organization operates in terms of opponent processing
    + autonomous nervous system: evolving the level of arousal to the env
+ bio-economic properties
    + logistics norms: efficiency and resiliency
        + in tradeoff relationship, opponent processing
+ theory of the evolution of individual cognitive-interactional fittedness
    + how we shape the problem space to adapt to the env

## Embodied/Embedded

Reject:

+ empiricist notion of relevance detection
+ romantic notion of relevance projection

#### R is embodied:

+ dependency from propositional to participatory
+ dependency btw:
    + cognitive agency as a general problem solver
    + brain existing within a bio-economy/body
+ body is an auto-poietic bio-economy that makes cognition possible
    + reject Descartes (clay), Plato (vehicle)
    + RR is not possible without is

#### R is embedded:

+ biological fittedness: relation btw creature and its env
+ adaptivity is not an intrinsic property, it is a relation/affordance btw object and env
+ R is not a property of the subjectivity/objectivity of the mind
    + R is a property of a real relation
    + eg. bottle being graspable
+ R is not sth we subjectively project (romantic)
+ R is not sth we detect objectively (empiricist)

#### R is transjective

+ real relationship between organism and its env
    + not projected
    + not detected
+ relevance is realized
    + objective sense of realization: making real
    + subjective sense of realization: coming into awareness
    + triangulate to the transjectivity
+ anti-Cartesian: mind needs body
+ world and organism are co-creating/evolving
+ subjective-objective dichotomy need to be transcended
+ spirituality: functional sense of connectedness that affords wisdom, self-transcendence

## Efficiency-Resiliency Tradeoff
+ optimize btw the two
+ RR, auto-poesis and adaptivity are interrelated

### Non-exhaustive list of tradeoff examples

> Ways in which you can trade efficiency and resiliency, and create virtual engines that adapt (while being constrained) the sensory-motor loop, interactions with the env in an evolving manner.

+ RR is inherently dynamic and developmental; a self organizing system
    + develops by functioning
    + functions by developing
    + also inherently self-transcending

efficient | resilient | external (!= objectivity, interactional) vs internal (!=subjectivity, bioeconomics)
--- | --- | ---
general purpose machine | special purpose machine | external
compression | particularization | internal
applicability | cognitive scope |
exploitation | exploration |  external |
reward error reduction | reward error increase / risk taking | external
TDL | IR | internal
focusing | diversifying | external (flexible gambling)
integration/assimilation | differentiation/accomodation | internal (developmental - Piaget)

+ tradeoff normativity, opponent processing btw efficiency and resiliency
    + cost vs benefits
+ special purpose machine (SPM) and general purpose machine (GPM) are both adaptive
    + GPM (hand): makes efficient
    + SPM (hammer, screwdriver): makes resilient
    + constant trade btw them
+ how to make information processing more efficient:
     + make functions as generalizable as possible
     + line of best fit (regression): interpolate & extrapolate --> to make predictions, generalize
     + data compression: pick up on what's invariant
     + make the system more cross-contextual
+ how to make information processing more resilient
     + particularization; eg. WS algo
     + overfitting: pick up on more variations
     + make the system more context-sensitive
+ trading btw efficiency and resiliency
     + "obeying" to logistical
     + organisms moving btw the two dynamically
     + differences btw species
     + individual differences: overfitting (featurely bound) vs overgeneralizing (connections where there are no connections)
+ exploration vs exploitation - projectability
    + timing, opportunity cost; should I stay here (exploit) or move and find new sources (explore)
+ GANs: reward error reduction (conscientiousness) vs reward error increase (risk taking, curious) - cognitive temporing
    + temporal displacement learning (TDL): reward error reduction
    + inhibition return (IR): reward error increase
+ relevant
    + sometimes what's invariant
    + sometimes how sth changes
    + constant shifting, tradeoff in reality
+ tradeoff btw cost functions (CF)
    + cognitive prioritization:
        + flexible gambling: how many CFs you activate
        + focusing vs diversifying
+ scope vs tempering: prioritization plays between them - dynamic
    + RR is taking place in the state space between them
+ how RR is developmental (Piaget)
     + cognitive schema: set of constraints
     + compression: integration, assimilation
         + new info as same
         + need it not fly apart as a system/organism
     + particularization: differentiation, accommodation
         + new info as different
         + exploratory emotions ('ah')
         + opens you up, change your structure, new frame
         + need it to respond to a more complex env
+ simultaneous integrating & differentiating of a system/organism: complexification
    + self-transcendence
    + egg & sperm: zygote
        + first cells just reproduce
        + cells start to differentiate
        + then start to self-organ-ize (heart, eye, lung, etc.), (assimilate)
    + emergent abilities
    + as a system complexifies, going through RR, it gets new emergent abilities of how it can interact with the env --> extend that RR into the emergent self-transcendence

## RR and GI

+ GI involves a tradeoff between a lot of different heuristics, BUT:
+ RR is a unified phenomena
+ assert and substantiate that GI ~= RR

### RR and GI explains

+ Spearman: g-factor (robust finding, replicable)
    + different task performances predict each other (math, English, sports)
    + strong positive manifold: inter-predictability <-- GI
+ testing for intelligence: testing for GI

phenomenon | GI subtest
--- | ---
problem formulation | comprehension
similarity judgements | similarities and picture concepts
"eduction" of latent info from experience / pattern finding | similarities and picture concepts
adaptation to unpredictable envs | complex, g-loaded workplaces
solving ill-defined problems | complex, g-loaded workplaces

+ RR is the underlying ability of GI
+ GI predict the most of you: performance, health maintenance, relationships (but: there are other factors as well)
    + intelligence != rationality

> RR can be understood as a dynamic developmental evolution of your sensory motor fittedness that is regulated by virtual engines that are ultimately regulated by the logistical normativity of the opponent processing between efficiency and resiliency.

## RR and cogsci integration
+ psychology
+ beginnings of biology
+ AI
+ dynamical processes in the brain - todo, next episode

### Scientific explanation of RR

+ everything feeds into RR (convergence argument)
+ RR is embedded in our procedural, perspectival, participator knowing
+ RR is embedded in our transjected dynamical coupling to the env
+ RR is embedded to the agent-arena relationship
     + connectivity btw mind and body/world
+ RR is central to intelligence
+ RR is central to the functionality of consciousness
+ if naturalistic explanation succeeds --> we can explain
    + why we are inherently self-transcending
    + the relationship btw intelligence & rationality & wisdom
    + human spirituality
    + --> maybe address powerfully the meaning crisis
