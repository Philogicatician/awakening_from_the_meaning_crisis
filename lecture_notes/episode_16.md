# Episode 16 - Christianity and Agape

## Agape

+ unconditional love
+ god is the open future
+ love that is creation; how to participate in it (not just receive it as the child)
    + love that creates persons and future
    + parental: non-person ---> person
    + ongoing creation of history/open future, persons
    + your personal, kairos --> metanoia, transformation
    + sacrifice: death of Jesus
    + for-giveness: giving before the other person earned it
        this is how we grow up receiving it
    + giving up ego-centrism
+ participatory love: knowing someone in depth (mutual) --> gnosis

## Personal Meaning Crises

Saul --> Paul (<-- stoicism) --> Augustine --> Luther --> meaning crisis:
+ personalized exodus: old me vs new me
+ danger of eros: projecting oneself onto the other (things I don't understand in myself; self-knowledge is necessary for love relationships)
+ inner conflict: law, order vs love ~ God's inner conflict internalized
+ God's inner conflict:
    1. justice, order, judgement, morality (honesty, courageousness) --> perfection --> we fail --> we are condemned to death
    2. agapic parental love (by Jesus' sacrifice)

reality: conflict between justice and agape
+ people who have inner conflict (failed their own expectations) find solace in Christianity
+ we pay a price for the gifts: relief
+ we still believe the grammar of god (justice vs agape), but we don't beleive in it

Aristotle: nomological order of meaning, worldview attunement
