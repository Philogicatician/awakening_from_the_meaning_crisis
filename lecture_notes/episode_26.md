# Episode 26 - Cognitive Science

+ *meaning making*
    + romanticism
+ *meaning seeking/receiving*
    + empiricism
+ *meaning cultivation*
    + cogsci

## Equivocation

1. "Nothing is better than long life and happiness."
2. "A peanut butter sandwich is better than nothing."
Inference:
3. Eat a sandwich and commit suicide.

+ different sets of meaning/reference for `nothing`

### Mind is an equivocal term

+ fragmentation of sciences of the mind
    + hybridization, philosophically astute integration
    + what's meaning generation process, how mind makes sense

## 3 kinds of CogSci

1. **nominalism**
2. **eclecticism**
    + ~interfaith dialogue
3. **synoptic integration**
     + addresses equivocation, fragmentation, ignorance
     + how the levels/disciplines are causally interacting
     + create linking disciplines
     + our brains do bridging between domains by metaphors

## Metaphor

> Sam is a pig.

+ difference relation: gets you outside of the frame
+ identity relation
+ restructures Sam
+ balance between distance and identity: metaphor is *apt*
+ identity too strong: `Bees are hornets.`
      + no insight
+ difference too great: `Arguments are chairs.`
      + made by humans
      + daily usage

### Apt balance of theoretical constructs between disciplines

#### Plausibility

+ see sth in psycho through the lens of linguistics
+ constructs that provoke insightful transformations
+ how do I know a construct is successful:
    + __**plausibility**__ (not high prob): making good sense (normative theory: how to do it well)
        + elegance/**multi-aptness** (how it is used)
        + **trustworthiness*
+ **trustworthiness**: produced by convergent, independent lines of research
    + eg. trusting info coming from multiple senses/channels (avoid bias)
        + trustworthiness (`!=` truth)
    + experimentation and observation
+ **multi-aptness** only:
    + *conspiracy theory*
+ **trustworthiness/convergence** only:
    + *triviality*
+ *equivocating*: *deepety*:
    + *Love is only a four letter world.*
    + `triviality + equivocating == bullshit`
    + *Motte-and-Bailey strategy*:
        + abusing the machinery for bullshit
+ improving: high convergence & high elegance
    + highly plausible: trustworthy and powerful multi-aptness: profound (`!=` truth)
    + reasonable and should be taken seriously

## CogSci

+ producing constructs that bridge between disciplines,
+ profound synoptic integration that addresses:
    + equivocation,
    + fragmentation,
    + ignorance of the causality between the levels

### CogSci of meaning cultivation

+ cultivation of wisdom/plant: between you and world

#### Example

+ faculty of meaning cultivation that makes you a cognitive agent: intelligence
+ measure/test general problem solving capacity across different domains
+ making intelligence (AGI)

`intelligent != rational`

> What we ultimately care about is not how intelligent you are, but how rational you can become.

+ intelligence `!=` possessing knowledge
    + although knowledge makes you adaptive to your environment
+ what is it to solve a problem ?
    + the focus is on the process
+ what is it to have a problem:

1. initial state
2. operations/edges/paths to change between states/nodes
3. path constraints
    + eg. cooking lunch by burning down your house
        + does not preserve me as a general problem solver
4. goal state

+ 1-4. problem/search space
