# Episode 20 - Death of the Universe

## Recap

+ Augustine:
    + integrating together the three orders
+ changes:
    + psychotech of reading:
        + from participatory to consumption of info
    + knowledge:
        + from transformative conformity to the world to coherence between propositions
+ Aquinas: __two real worlds__:
    + **natural**: understood by reason
    + **supernatural**: understood by faith
        + *love* transforms/moves the *will*
        + will asserts propositions to be true
    + threat:
        + as the supernatural world becomes less viable
            + love separates from reason
            + spirituality separates from science

## Meister Eckhart (1260-1328)

+ influenced by Neoplatonism, Gnosticism
+ empty the self
    + overcoming attachment to one's thinking/self-image
+ change in the *normative order*

### Spirituality

+ Neoplatonism:
    + anagoge
    + conformity to the world
    + ascent through reason: self-transcendence
    + wisdom: educating yourself in self-transcendence to improve meaning in life
+ Augustine:
    + will moves the love
    + ascent
+ Aquinas:
    + love moves the will
    + will becomes central to your spirituality
+ Rheinland mystics:
    + spirituality is God's descent to you
        + precedence: *theurgy*
    + love is the way the will moves
        + love is self-negation/sacrifice
        + will negates itself `==` love
        + to make space so God can dwell in me
        + spirituality is a battle of wills
            + mine vs God's
            + will negating its own self-assertion
            + making a space for God to flow in
        + self-negation/inner-conflict becomes central to spirituality
+ model of God `~` model of yourself
    + grammar of God has woven into our culture/cognition
        + belief in God is irrelevant

## Ockham (1287-1347)

+ __the source of God's being__
    + Augustine, Neoplatonism: **His reason**
        + love: creativity
    + Ockham: **His will**
        + God's assertions create
        + ascent through reason is gone
        + any order in existence is God's arbitrary will
        + God speaks the world into existence
+ **nominalism**
    + whatever pattern/category (eg. book) you find
        + you are making it by speaking about it
        + not by reasoning about it
	    	+ God is not bound by rationality/coherence
+ patterns are not actually there
+ knowledge is just in the head
	+ the way I'm using the language
+ there is no order in the world
    + order is only in the language
    + the world is absurd, not intelligible in itself
+ supernatural world is not reason or rational order
+ love/spirituality is self-sacrifice, self-negation of will
+ only patterns/order in the world is how we speak about them
    + there is no inherent suchness in things
+ God's will is arbitrary
	+ humans are arbitrary

## Bubonic Plague

+ end of the world
+ broken social structures
+ order given given/taken by God arbitrarily (power is arbitrary)

### Beginnings of Commercialism

+ labor shortage
+ people freely move
+ changing status by selling labor
+ change your life through your own efforts
+ making money by moving stuff around
+ disparity-demand

### New Psychotechs

+ processing information better:
	+ Arabic numbers
	+ negative numbers
	+ celestial navigation
	+ Aristotelian way of thinking

#### New Secular Institutions

+ banks
+ insurance companies
+ corporations

## Copernicus

> The math is better if we put the Sun in the center.

### What Is Real ?

+ __Aristotle__:
    1. relevant (sense) organ is functioning
    2. medium is not distorted 
    3. there is an agreement by rational discussion
    + being in *conformity/touch* with the world
+ __Copernicus__: 1-3 is not enough
    + *world-mind* separation
    + sensory experience is not enough
    + everything is an illusion
        + "How do you know that this table is here?"
        + "How do you know that your mother actually loved you?"
    + loss of participatory knowing
    + disconnection from the world

## Galileo

+ our perception deceives us
    + can't trust sensory experience
+ new scientific way:
    + Aristotelian logic &
    + new math &
    + careful observation
+ overcoming illusion and self-deception
+ math is the language of the universe
    + until then: geometry
    + new stuff: arithmetic, calculation
+ use geometry in an abstract sense
    + triangle to represent the relationship between distance and time
+ Galileo kills the universe:
    + inertial motion
    + no inner drive, purpose
    + **matter is dead**
+ the world is not purposeful
+ human is a little island
    + alone in a vast desert of **purposelessness**
    + matter **resists my will**
        + world pushes back on me
    + will vs resistance to will
+ mathematical properties are real, everything else is illusion

#### What is evil, then ?

+ __before__: pure being of chaos
+ __after__: evil just inert matter
    + or excessive immorality

#### Scientific method

+ mathematical measures are real/**objective**
+ non-math stuff (sunset, sweetness, meaning) is **subjective**:
    + in the mind, experience

#### Meaning Crisis

__World__:

+ is unordered, inert chaos, absurdity, indifferent

__I__:

+ am a battle of wills
    + our purposes are not real/meaningful
    + we are just atoms
    + trauma, stress, crisis: disconnection from the world

Dissolution of the axes of meaning

+ nomological, normative, narrative orders
