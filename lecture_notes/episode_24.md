# Episode 24 - Hegel

Nietzsche doesn't give appropriate answer to the meaning crisis.

Genealogy of the meaning crisis

## Hegel (H) (<-- Kant, Romantics)
+ axials: rationality moves closer to reality
+ Kant's framing: rational (self-enclosed, "thing in itself")
+ Romatics: irrational moves closer to reality
+ Hegel: "thing in itself" is unknowable, indistinguishable from non-existent --> let's get rid of it
+ idealism: reality is constructed by the mind
+ --> the real is the rational, rational is the real <-- connection between being and being known
    + sense of realness
    + how sth is intelligible, understandable to us (Platonic)
+ Kant: the mind is making the structures of rational experience of reality
+ Hegel: the mind is making the structures of reality itself
+ irrational part of the mind:
    + developmental potential of the reality (<-- Aristotle)
+ mind in an extended sense: patterns of intelligibility <-- structuring reality
    + --> developmental process
+ Geist: spirit & mind
    + living systems of patterns of intelligibility by which we ultimately make sense
    + patterns of making sense ~ patterns of reality
+ absolute idealism
+ how to study the living systems of patterns of intelligibility that structure experience --> studying history
+ study history
    + necessary for understanding reality
    + patterns/grammars of making sense culturally
    + realizing patterns: experience & made real (develop)
    + developmental processes of making sense:
          1. differentiation: contrasting, articulation: finding division points between things
          2. integration: making connection
+ systematization:
    + like in child development: new systems
+ internal development of Geist (like a child) through history:
     + a) idea (thesis) 
     + b) counter-idea (anti-thesis)
     + c) higher integration (synthesis)
     + c) starts the process all over again, recursively
     + --> complexification
     + --> dialectic
+ e.g. what is reality
    a. reality is changeless (Parmenides) - math
    b. reality is change (Heracleites) - experiments
    c. eternal patterns organize changing processes (Plato) - science
+ e.g. how science is progressing: Geist
       + self-transcendence, development --> more and more systematic making sense
+ reaching a point in history where the system of realization becomes aware of itself (H's hybris)
+ --> absolute Geist/idealism
+ rationality is a systematic process in the self-development of Geist
    + criticism: unpersonal
+ when the process reaches self-understanding: Understanding (things) --> Reason (systematic, self-reflective)
+ --> rationality realized itself & real is the rational --> reality realizes itself
+ this process of rationality and reality realizing themselves is God
    + God is a process by which we make sense and create the world (<-- Christinaity, Hebrew)
    + secular/philosophical account of history
    + rationalizing the Hebreic heritage <- non-religious God
    + God is realized by the contemplation of the philosopher (H)
+ translating religious terms into philosophical terms of rational development
    + how rationality, intelligibility and reality are co-developing
+ Program German Idealism:
    + we must have a new mythology
    + it must be in the service of ideas
    + it must be a mythology of Reason
    + in the end enlightened (philosophical) and unenlightened (mythological) must clasp hands
    + --> social political program
    + --> last and greatest work of mankind, last religion, utopia, final stage: geist is self-understanding

#### e.g.: Understanding --> Reason ~ Mythology --> Philosophy
+ Mytho - Philo
+ Father - understanding un-differentiated, un-articulated, un-actualized (thesis) - agape (making sense and persons)
+ Son - articulation into particular things (anti-thesis)
+ Son is sacrificed, reconciles with the Father - higher integration, realization of the identity indifference of the Father and Son
+ Holy Spirit, God is agape (making sense and making persons) - Geist, dwelling within the self-awareness, development of the community (synthesis)

+ H is restructuring Christianity in light of the Reformation and scientific revolution
+ H thinks his system exemplified total explanation (hybris)
+ grammar for spirituality & rationality (~ axial age): German ideology

### Criticism:
+ secularizing of religion --> totalitarianism

#### Schopenhauer: will to live is not addressed 
   + pushes to anti-religious existentialism

#### Kirkegard: 
+ H made a system and sat down beside it; too impersonal, lack of PP knowing; system of ideas/beliefs
* the attempt of realizing the divine / anagoge is separated from self-transformation (no mystical experience, no radical change, no Socratic challenge is needed)
* only conceptual/rational/propositional self-reflection is needed
* no transformative experience
* epistemic self-transcendence vs "ethical self-transcendence" <-- leap of faith, not reason your way through
* ~  Socrates' beef with natural philosophers
+ pushes to existentialism

#### Marx:
* history is driven by the monster (not the man, lion): socio-economic forces
* Feuerbach: religion is a projection, God is an ideal model of my own humanity --> alienates humans from their own role in history
* religion distracts people from how they are the authors of history
* shift to materialism --> dialectical materialism
* history: the clash between classes (not between ideas), conflict, political struggle --> promise land
* completing the secularization of Hegel --> supply the participation, (nothing to lose but our chains,  call to arms, revolution)
* violent, totalizing ideologies promising a secular utopia that is the culmination of the internal logic of history
* politicalization of faith, participation in kairos
+ --> H's totalizing ideology does not capture the core of human meaning making
