# Episode 26 - Cognitive Science

> meaning making - romanticism
> meaning seeking/receiving - empiricism
> --> meaning cultivation

## Equivocation
1. "Nothing is better than long life and happiness."
2. "A peanut butter sandwich is better than nothing."
Inference:
3. Eat a sandwich and commit suicide.

+ different sets of meaning/reference for `nothing`

### Mind is an equivocal term
Fragmentation of sciences of the mind
--> hybridization, philosophically astute integration
--> what's meaning generation process, how mind makes sense

## 3 kinds of CogSci

1. nominalism
2. eclecticism (~interfaith dialogue)
3. synoptic integration
     + addresses equivocation, fragmentation, ignorance
     + how the levels/disciplines are causally interacting
     + create linking disciplines
     + our brains do bridging between domains by metaphors

## Metaphor
> Sam is a pig.

+ difference relation: gets you outside of the frame
+ identity relation
+ restructures Sam
+ balance between distance and identity: metaphor is apt  
+ identity too strong: > Bees are hornets (lódarázs).
      - no insight
+ difference too great: > Arguments are chairs.
      - made by humans
      - daily usage

### Apt balance of theoretical constructs between disciplines
+ see sth in psycho through the lens of linguistics
+ multi-aptness/elegance
+ constructs that provoke insightful transformations
+ how do I know a construct is successful:
    + plausibility (not high prob): making good sense (normative theory: how to do it well)
          - elegance (how it is used)
 + trustworthiness: produced by convergent, independent lines of research
      * e.g trusting info coming from multiple senses/channels (avoid bias) --> trustworthiness (!= truth)
      * experimentation and observation
+ multi-aptness only: conspiracy theory
+ trustworthiness only: triviality
+ equivocating: deepety: Love is only a four letter world
     + triviality & equivocating = bullshit
+ MB strategy:
<-- abusing the machinery for bullshit
--> Improving: high convergence & high elegance --> highly plausible: trustworthy and powerful multi-aptness: profound (!= truth)
 + reasonable and should be taken seriously

## CogSci
+ producing constructs that bridge between disciplines,
+ profound synoptic integration that addresses:
    + equivocation,
    + fragmentation,
    + ignorance of the causality between the levels

### cogsci of meaning cultivation (~cultivation of wisdom, plant): between you and world
#### example:

faculty of meaning cultivation that makes you a cognitive agent: intelligence

+ measure/test general problem solving capacity across different domains
+ making intelligence (AGI)

intelligent != rational

+ "what we ultimately care about is not how intelligent you are, but how rational you can become"

intelligence != possessing knowledge
+ although knowledge makes you adaptive to your environment

what is it to solve a problem ? --> the focus is on the process
what is it to have a problem:
1. initial state
2. operations/edges/paths to change between states/nodes
3. path constraints (eg. cooking lunch by burning down your house) - preserve me as a general problem solver
4. goal state
<-- problem/search space
