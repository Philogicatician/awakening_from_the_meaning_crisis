# Episode 37 - Reverse Engineering Enlightenment

## Recap

+ proposal for *the* sacred (that which generated **sacredness):
transjective inexhausibility
    + anagoge between the *no-thingness* of the ever evolving RR and
the *no-thingness* of the comb explosive reality dynamically changing
itself
+ role of the *symbolic*: helping us to activate the primordial
aspects of religio
    + process of re-exaptation --> new emergent abilities, opening up
the world/ourselves
+ indispensibility != metaphysical necessity/absolute essence
+ *the sacred* is not a supernatural, absolute form of relevance
+ *sacredness* facilitates the higher order RR:
    + homing us against *domicide*: __meta-assimilation__
    + confronting the *numenous*: __meta-accommodation__
+ question: how *the sacred* helps us address perennial problems (PPs)
+ answer:
    + perennial problems
        + the experience of sacredness that activates religio should address PPs
        + the machinery (of religio) that makes us adaptive also makes
us vulnerable to self-deceptive/destructive behavior
        + most cultures cultivate an ecology of psychotechs/practices
that address PPs
        + these psychotechs should fit into a legitimizing worldview
        + these psychotechs have to be integrated with sacredness
    + historical factors
        + they undermined the experience of sacredness
        + they undermined the ways of cultivating psychotechs for
enhancing religio
        + lack of worldview that affords self-transcendence, HSC, gnosis
        + autodidactive solutions emerge dangerously without any
wisdom traditions

## Perennial Problems (PPs)

Features of religio:

### Functional Features

+ in reality these features are interacting and exacerbate each other
    + permutations are complex
+ *addressing the problem*: not ideas to believe, but
internalized/integrated practices
    + has to happen within a *wisdom framing*
    + reverse engineering enlightenment
        + *enlightenment* as in an ecology of practices that reliably
address PPs
        + have a scientific theory / naturalistic account of enlightenment

#### Self-organization

+ opponent processing:
    + self-organizing criticality (SOC)
    + trade-off relationships: compression vs particularization
+ downside: __parasitic processing__
    + complex self-organizing system
    + adaptively resistant to attempts of intervening
+ addressing the problem:
    + __cultivating a counter-active dynamical system__ (not an ideological one)
    + ecology of practices
    + eg. cultivation of the *eightfold path* (eight-spoked wheel)
        + right (aspiration/concentration): optimal fittedness (enhanced RR)
        + set of mutually supporting practices: self-rolling wheel
(*entering the stream*)
        + parable of the goldsmith (gold ~ mind):
            1. looks at the gold ~ meditation
            2. heats up the gold ~ right effort, flow
            3. shapes the gold ~ cultivation of new skills
            + need all the three above tp become a goldsmith; the
practices are complementary (with their strengths and weaknesses)
            + the gold becomes *wieldy*: easy to handle
     + constellation of lower order skills to build higher order skills
     + operates on many levels of our cognition and consciousness

#### Self-identification

+ process of creating an identity
+ downside: __modal confusion__
    + confusion between the *having* vs *being* modes
    + `I-it` vs `I-thou`
+ addressing the problem:
    + practices that invoke __remembering the being mode__: *sati*

#### Self-reflection

+ axial age: advent of second order thinking
+ downside: __reflectiveness gap__
    + loss of agency (Hamlet)
+ addressing the problem:
    + __cultivation of the *flow state*__
    + dynamic integration of *immersion* and creative *flexibility*
    + eg. giving a lecture, jazz
    + eg. daoism: yin-yang, in-out, making frame-breaking frame
    + todo:
        + set up the practices/conditions that afford flow
        + wisely cultivate your flow (where and what domains you
practice flow in)

### Structural Features

+ agent-arena relationship
+ self is connected to:
    + the world:
        + downside: __absurdity__:
            + arguments explaining it are *after the fact expressions*,
            + nevertheless the experience is real
            + clash of perspectives (some of it resolvable by humor)
       + addressing the problem:
            + Spinoza: __*scientia intuitiva*__: Ethics
                + bringing back blessedness/sacredness into the
Cartesian worldview;
                + ethics: becoming the best person leading the best kind of life
                + experience is co-created by the body and the world
                + intuitive kind of knowing: *scientia intuiitiva*:
                    + tight logical structure that afford it:
                    + meta-argument reaching up to the largest scale
of reality ~ sentence
                    + arguments ~ words
                    + individual premises ~ letters
            + Buddhism: __*prajna*__
                + self-liberating state of wisdom
                + simultaneous attentional scaling up/down; looking in
and out; PCE and resonant at-onement
                + non-dual awareness: maximum breaking frame and
maximum making frame integrated; insight
                + the world and you are co-creating
            + Eckhart: "The eye by which I see God, is the eye by
which God sees me."
            + interpenetration of perspectives: alleviating the clash
            + no argumentative response to absurdity
    + itself
        + downside: __anxiety__:
            + inner conflict (Plato, Paul, Augustine)
            + self-deception - skewed salience landscape
            + sth in inherently wrong with me
            + constant threat without target (!= fear)
                + threat is the state of inner war
        + addressing the problem:
            + __*inner dialogue*__
            + internalizing the sage: role model of how to engage in dialogue
            + identification practice:
                + internalizing others
                + indwelling (Polanyi): proceeding through the
pen/probe: what is it like to see things the sage does
                    + seriously play the sage (without arrogance, inflation)
            + eg. Stoicism: internalizing Socrates
            + eg. Buddhism: realizing your Buddha nature
            + eg. Christianity: not `I who live`, but `the Christ who
lives in me`
            + eg. Jung: active imagination
            + eg. lectio divina: allow different aspects of the psyche
to talk to each other through the text
            + cogsci: how different centers of the brain are operating
    + others
        + downside: __alienation__:
            + inability to connect
        + addressing the problem:
            + cultivating *communitas*: sense of connectedness to others
            + shared spirit/identity
            + collective flow & real communication/communion
            + re-accessing other kinds of (lost)
procedural/perspectival/participatory/ knowings:
                + communication != propositional exchange/conflict
                + most of our real world problem solving is done in
concert wit others: distributed cognition/collective intelligence
            + eg. authentic discourse/relating (P. Limberg)
                + insight rather than winning in a debate
            + eg. circling: collective flow & mindfulness & platonic dialogue
                + dynamical system that gives people the resources to
be in touch with themselves
            + emergence of collective from individual parts, that's
way more than the sum of the parts

### Developmental Features

+ cognition is inherently developmental:
    + functions by developing
    + develops by functioning
+ qualitative development
    + capacity for self-transcendence
+ optimization process

#### Existential Inertia

+ moving between worldviews
+ need for anagoge

#### Existential Ignorance

+ we cannot infer propositionally* the *perspectival* knowledge of *trying*:
    + what do I miss
    + what do I lose

#### Existential entrapment

+ existential inertia & existential ignorance
+ mythologized by the gnostics
+ addressing the problem:
    + cultivationof __*gnosis*__, HSC, therapy
    + open-ended mythos

+ constellate the ecology of practices from the individual practices
(within a wisdom framing)
