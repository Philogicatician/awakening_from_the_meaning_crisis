# Episode 44 - Theories of Wisdom

## Recap

### Theories of Wisdom

+ Schwartz & Sharp
    + linking wisdom to virtue & positive psychology
        + criticism: 
            + should include *sophia*, not just *phronesis* in the account of wisdom (like in Aristotle)
            + `phronesis != expertise`
            + lacking developmental aspect: becoming a virtuous person
            + lacking connection of wisdom with meaning in life
+ Baltes & Stadinger
    + metaheuristics/pragmatics: improved capacity for RR
        + connection between *intelligence* and *wisdom* via *rationality*
    + 5 criteria:
        + propositional knowing (what)
        + procedural knowing (how)
        + perspectival knowing (contextualism)
        + relativism
            + criticism: use *humility* and *fallibilism* instead
        + wisdom is applicable in domains of uncertainty
            + huge aspect of our cognition (ill-definedness, comb explosion) 
            + RR is presupposed here

## Wisdom Theories and Critiques

###  Baltes & Stadinger

+ wisdom application with *generativity, flexibility, efficiency*
    + RR machinery invoked again:

> Within the frame of bounded rationality, highly complex sets of information about the meaning and conduct of life are reduced quickly to their essentials, without being lost in the never-ending process of information search, that were to occur if wisdom was treated as a case of unbounded rationality.

#### Experimental Work:

+ operationalization of wisdom with the 5 criteria
+ the cognitive style *judgement* predicts good results
+ (imagining of) discussing with another person enhances the capacity for wisdom
    + Platonic inner dialogue
    + Stoic internalizing the sage
    + challenging the individualistic notion of rationality (Descartes, Cohen) 
    + possible explanation: *Solomon-effect*: moving to a 3rd person perspective
    + to overcome bias induction and *transparency* of the 1st person perspective
    + provoking *aporia*

#### Criticism: 

+ `wisdom != expertise`
+ not being clear on perspectival knowing
+ this is a *product theory* of wisdom:
        + account of wisdom, criteria list
+ missing what is present in ancient theories of wisdom (Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics):
    + the legacy we should not ignore
    + developmental aspect / centrality of *transformational change*
    + *process theory*:
        + gives an independent account of
            + *foolishness* - how to overcome it
            + *flourishing* - how to afford it
        + from those derives what wisdom is
        + i.e. deriving what wisdom is from how one becomes wise
        + picking on the central insight of `seeing throgh illusion and into reality` (McGee & Barber)
+ the *process theory* should be complementary to the *product theory*
    + how foolishness develops
    + how to overcome foolishness
    + how to afford flourishing
    + on that basis get into dialogue with accounts of what wisdom is

### M. Ardelt: Criticism of Baltes & Stadinger, 2004

+ `*having* theoretical knowledge about wisdom != *being* wise`
    + modal confusion
    + knowledge is necessary, but not sufficient
    + *truth* and *transformative relevance* are needed to be kept together (Socrates)
    + a wise person must realize the *theoretical truths* within the process of *self-transformation*
    + self-transcendence allows the wise person to *embody/enact* these truths, not just propositionally *having* them
+ importance of the process of development
+ wisdom is *becoming* a particular kind of person living in a particular kind of world
    + indicates *participatory knowing*
+ J. Kekes: distinction between *descriptive* and *interpretive* knowledge
    + descriptive knowledge: factual (eg. the cat is a mammal)
    + interpretive knowledge: grasping the *significance* of descriptive knowledge
        + how *understanding* differs from *knowledge*
+ centrality of *understanding* in wisdom
+ **grasping** (construal) the **significance** (RR)
+ personality characteristics of wise people; 3 crucial dimensions: of personhood
    1. **cognitive** factors
        + ability having the comprehension of the *significance* and meaning of information
        + *significance* wrt your developmental process
        + intelligence: to grasp what is relevant
        + *understanding*
    2. **reflective** aspect
        + the reflective component of rationality
        + multi-perspectivalness, self-examination/awareness
        + existential import of reflection: internalize the perspectival ability
        + overcoming ego-centrism perspectivally
    3. **affective** component
        + *compassion*: the capacity for *agape*
            + overcoming ego-centrism in terms of attitude/motivations/caring/preferences
                + caring directed towards the flourishing of others
                + supplement by Vervaeke: connectedness/caring to ground **meaning in life** (transjective coupling)
    + mutually influencing/constraining each other
    + equal priority to cognitive, perspectival (rationality), affective components
        + direct connection of *wisdom* to *meaning in life* with the affective component
        + connection to virtues is not sufficient

#### Criticism

+ invokes *transformative experience*, but it is not a *processing theory*
+ does not give an independent account on *foolishness*

### Sternberg (1998)

+ running through the history of the psychology of wisdom
+ connecting psychology of wisdom to pedagogy/education (like the ancient theories)
    + engineering psychotechs to bring the cultivation of wisdom to the educational domain

#### Phronesis, Sophia, Episteme

+ *episteme*: scientific/propositional knowledge
+ *sophia*: contemplation of practical wisdom
    + like S2, reflective
+ zeroing in on *phronesis*: 
    + like S1
+ *tacit knowledge*:
    + subsidiary awareness (Polanyi)
    + not explicitly taught
    + *procedural* knowing: *techne*
    + implicit learning, intuition
+ *tacit understanding*
    + invoking RR
    + machinery to grasp the significance of our knowledge
    + guiding our ability to 
        + adapt to situations,
        + shape them (construal/problem formulation)
        + select the environment (exploration vs exploitation)
    + solving practical problems
        + which are unformulated, or in need of re-formulation
            + with insight, RR
+ view of wisdom:

> The theory views wisdom as inherent in the interaction between an individual and a situational context. Wisdom depends on the fit of a wise solution to its context.

+ inherently transjective, fitting
+ `balance == optimization`

#### Schematic Diagram

+ top down, with bottom up arrows:

-------------

+ ~~common good~~, `virtue`, `meaning in life`

+ *balance* your response to the env: `adapting`, `shaping`, `selecting`
    + invoking RR 

+ *balance* your interests between (the 3 dimensions of *connectedness* of meaning in life):
    + **intra**-personal (connection to oneself)
    + **inter**-personal (connection to others)
    + **extra**-personal (connection to the world)

`tacit understanding`

-------------

+ *common good* is a value in the liberal-democratic framework
    + but not necessarily shared by all wise people at all times (eg. Stoics)
    + might be an anachronistic approach
        + this is not a criticism of liberal-democratic values
+ *values* in boxes are pointing to the levels in the diagram:
    + interpretation: not clear which values
        + maybe that the wise person is governed by normativity
+ *balance* used to *adapt, shape, select* the environment:
    + similar to Piaget's *optimization* between *assimilation* and *accommodation* 
    + balance between coping with novelty and proceduralization (like RR)
+ connection to *meaning in life* with the 3 types of connections
+ *tacit knowledge*: grasping the significance of knowledge and patterns from the env (RR)

#### Criticism

+ still a *product theory*, not a *process theory*
    + unexplicated vales
    + *tacit knowledge* could be more clearly explained
    + *optimization* could be more clearly explained
    + *RR* and how it connects to *meaning in life* could be more clearly explained
    + needs an independent theory of foolishness

### Summary and Plans

+ how the wisdom theories improve, converge
    + connections to the idea of RR: how RR can help to explain
        + what it is to be/become wise
+ next up is Vervaeke's account of wisdom:
    + a *process theory* of wisdom with connection to RR
    + plus criticism
    + cultivation of wisdom/meaning in life/enlightenment
