# Episode 27 - Problem Formulation

cogsci: creating cognitive constructs that afford synoptic integration

## Problem/search space: from god's eye view
1. initial state
2. operations/edges/paths to change between states/nodes
3. obeying path constraints
4. goal state

when encountering a problem we don't know the paths, and goal states
calculating nr of paths: `F**D`
+ chess:
     + F: nr of stages: 60
     + D: nr of paths: 30
     + `F**D: 30**60 = 4.29 *10**88`
     --> combinatorial explosion
+ cannot search the whole space --> have to reduce the problem space, zero in on the relevant info: relevance realization
<-- part of intelligence
    + generation of obviousness
    + how things are salient
--> restructure (dynamic self-organization) obvious and salient

## How to avoid combinatorial explosion
Newel & Simon

#### Algorithm

+ guaranteed to find a solution / prove that a solution exists
+ eg. multiplication
+ find certainty (Descartes' problem)
+ deductive logic, math: normativity of certainty
+ search the whole problem space, combinatorial explosion
--> cognitive suicide, overwhelmed
+ rationality != logical
--> rationality: when, where, how much, what degree to be logical
     applying other psychotechs than logic
     
#### Heuristic

+ problem solving method increasing your chances to find the solution
+ achieving your goal is not guaranteed
+ pre-specify where you should search, limit search space
+ pre-judge what's relevant (adaptive)  --> possible source of bias (self-deception)
+ same machinery that makes you adaptive also makes you susceptible for self-deception
+ eg. availability heuristic, representative heuristic (plane crashes vs car crashes)

#### Analysis: (~Thales): complex to basic components
Formalization: graphical representation (~Descartes), problem space
Mechanize: carry out formal analysis

#### Fallacy of circular explanation (often happening when explaining the mind):
+ triangle & homunculus: using vision explaining vision (~mind explaining mind)
Newel & Simon:
+ analyze, formalize and mechanize intelligence/mind to explain it with non-mental terms: scientific method
<-- naturalistic imperative: explain things naturalistically (favor for the scientific worldview): avoid circular explanation
+ naturalistic/scientific worldview lacks an explanation for generation scientific explanations (common criticism from post-modernists)
    + fit us back to the scientific worldview

### JV's criticism Newel & Simon:
+ notion of heuristic: necessary but insufficient in how we define the problem space:
+ assumption: all problems are essentially the same,
    + one problem solving strategy is enough
    + formulation: is trivial
    
#### Heuristic of essentialism:
* categories (referenced by words) share an essence
* looking for essences to generalize --> make predictions
+ triangle, gold: have essence
+ game, chair: don't have essence (Wittgenstein)
+ problem: (many different kinds)
    + well-defined: eg. multiplication problem
         + prevalence in education
         + psychotechs make them for us: numeracy, literacy
         + formulation in trivial, well formulated already
    + ill-defined: most problems
         + don't know relevant info on
             + initial state, goal state, operators, path constraints
         + eg: take good notes, tell a joke, successful date
         + missing problem formulation
         + how to zero in relevant info, constrain the problem

## Problem Formulation
+ relevance realization: constraining the problem space to avoid combinatorial explosion
+ need to be able to deal with ill defined problems: intelligence

### Kaplan & Simon (1990): Mutilated chess board: (In search of insight)

+ cover with dominoes
+ remove two squares (64-2) same diagonal corners
+ prove if possible to cover with 31 dominoes
+ covering strategy/formulation/problem: combinatorial explosion
--> parity (coloring) strategy/problem: dominoes always cover black and white: search space collapses

problem formulation turning ill-defined problems to well-defined problems: insight
+ insight is central to rationality
+ rationality = logic (improve inference) + insight
+ need psychotech to improve insight:
      + mindfulness: restructure salience landscape

problem formulation & relevance realization are central to being a general problem solver, avoiding:
+ combinatorial explosion
+ ill-definedness
