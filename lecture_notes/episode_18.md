# Episode 18 - Plotinus and Neoplatonism

### Dangers of higher states:

+ self deception, parasitic processing
+ need community, feedback

## Gnosticism

+ existential inertia: the world is not a nice place
    + the creator is evil or stupid
+ god of the old testament is punishing, evil, keeping you from self-realization, true agency, in trap
+ let's not serve the gods
+ myths: matrix, star wars
+ dark side:
    + conspiracy theories: there must be an evil force at work
        + Nazism: Jews as followers of the old God, are bad
        + belonging to the chosen few

### We have to salvage:

+ gnosis from Gnosticism
+ agape from Christianity
+ wisdom from the Aristotelian nomological order
+ rediscover sacredness that saves of from existential suffering and affords self-transformation
+ `Gnosticism-Jung` like `Stoicism-cognitive therapy`

## Plotinus (Neoplatonism), 270 AC

+ integrating:
+ Plato's spirituality: anagoge
+ Aristotle's world view: theory of knowing, structure of the world;
+ conformity theory: to know sth is by sharing the same structural-functional organization
+ levels of being/realness/reality:
+ lowest: pure potentiality
+ highest: pure actuality
+ stoics: overcoming modal confusion, therapy
+ Christianity:
+ participatory: as we conform --> higher reality --> higher state of self --> higher reality --> mode of being
what is real ? what do we sense is real ?
+ what is sensed to be integrated, how one it is -- what is structurally-functionally organized
+ object is more real than the shadow
+ understanding whats behind many things
+ more integrated --> more actualized --> more real --> my inner conflict is reduced --> anagoge
+ the one: cant have it --> be it (participatory knowing)
+ not theory (propositional): existential mode: world is more real, I'm more aware of whats real
+ cant know it, cant have it --> be it, being one (as experience)
+ integrated (mutually supported) system:
+ best science (Aristotle; rational argumentation)
  + best spirituality (Plato; higher states, transformation)
       + best therapy/emotional work (Stoicism)-->
