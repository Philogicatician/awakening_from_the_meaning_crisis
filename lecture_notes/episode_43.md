# Episode 43 - Wisdom and Virtue

## Recap

+ theory of rationality by Stanovich
    + *need for cognition*
        + curiosity: problem finding, generation of a *problem nexus*
        + wonder
    + foolishness/disrationalia
        + __dual processing__: S1 and S2
            + S1 leaps to conclusion inappropiately `-->` bias/self-deception
            + AOM foregrounds S2 and protects from S1 interference/leaping
    + S2 ans AOM are useful in a __theoretical__ context
    + but: in a __therapeutic__ context:
        + we need cognitive leaping (S1), predictive of insight (Jacobs)
        + cannot infer your way out of *existential entrapment/inertia/ignorance*
        + need insight for transformative/qualitative change
        + need a *cognitive style* to foreground S1 and trigger insight (Tiesdale)
            + mindfulness facilitates insight/cognitive flexibility
+ need to coordinate the opponent processing between S1 and S2
    + to optimize enhancement in rationality and intelligence (RR)
+ *rationality* is how you relate to/recur/improve your intelligence
    + *wisdom* is how you relate to/recur/improve your rationality
        + by optimizing the trade-off between the cognitive styles: AOM and mindfulness
+ the way you frame your intelligence (mindset) has an impact on your
    + problem solving
    + need for cognition
    + proclivity towards self-deception

## Theories of Wisdom

### McGee & Barber

+ central feature of wisdom is *seeing through illusion an into reality*
    + how become better systematically at dealing with self-deception 
        + which is rationality

### Schwartz & Sharp: Practical Wisdom, Aristotle Meets Positive Psychology (2006)

+ relationship between virtue and wisdom
+ virtue as a form of human excellence
+ problem with the list-of-virtues view of wisdom (Peterson)
    + *feature list* of virtues carries the assumption that they are logically independent
    + *maximize* each virtue independently 
+ we should have a *feature schema* instead: a *structural-functional organization*
    + explaining how virtues relate to each other
    + *optimizing* instead of *maximizing*
        + eg. honesty interferes with kindness ("you look ugly")
+ interdependence of the virtues (Greeks)
    1. they form an interdependent system
    2. different versions of a core ability

#### The 3 Interconnected Problems of Virtues

+ which is the relevant virtue to bring to bear in a situation ?
    + __problem of conflict__: which is more important
+ eg. when selecting a wedding dress for your friend
    + kindness vs honesty vs helpfulness
+ eg. grading an essay of a B+ student who used to be a C
    + honesty vs guidance

> Real life situations do not come labeled with the needed virtues or strengths attached. There is the problem of relevance.

+ virtues are often represented with *rules*
    + eg. "be kind"
        + does not *specify* its conditions of application
            + cannot capture relevance in rules (comb explosion)
            + rule application/specification depends on RR
    + __problem of relevance/specification__
+ 4th problem (Vervaeke):
    + sometimes we realize in a situation that we need to develop a virtue that we do not have
        + aspirational response
    + __problem of development__
        + the developmental process depends on the capacity of insight, transformative experience

#### Proposal

+ we need a higher order ability that deals with
    + relevance
        + conflict
        + specification
        + development
    + and that is *wisdom*
        + you need wisdom in order to be virtuous
        + each virtue is a particular way of being wise in a situation

#### Sophia vs Phronesis

+ Aristotle's distinction
+ __phronesis__: practical wisdom
    + need it for virtue
    + *know how*
    + being contextually sensitive, exercise good judgement
        + knowing how (procedural)
        + situational awareness (perspectival)
    + **not** like having rules
        + `having laws != being wise`
        + balance between legislation and cultivating wisdom
            + will this legislation reduce harm ?
            + will this legislation make people less likely to the cultivation of wisdom/virtue ?
+ __sophia__: theoretical wisdom/knowledge
    + having of rules/propositions
    + awareness of principles
        + cross-contextual sensitivity: generalizable broadly
            + ontological depth perception: seeing underlying principles
+ opponent relationship of phronesis (processes) and sophia (principles)
    + need to know how to put principles into processes
    + need to know how to regulate processes with principles
    + need both: fitting yourself to a specific situation & generalizing across situations

__Criticism by Vervaeke__:

1. *sophia* is not merely having rules
2. *phronesis* is not domain-specific expertise
    + it is being contextually sensitive in many different contexts (domain general ability)
        + RR, intelligence, rationality
        + we are foolish in a domain-general fashion

### Baltes & Stadinger: the Berling Wisdom Paradigm, 2000

+ seminal work that turned the investigation of wisdom experimental/empirical process
+ title:

> Wisdom: A Metaheuristic (Pragmatic) to Orchestrate Mind and Virtue Toward Excellence

+ deep connection between wisdom and virtue
+ excellence: positive psychology
+ metaheuristic, pragmatic: RR plays a significant role
+ __pragmatic__:
    + linguistics: conversational implicature - conveying more than saying (Grice)
        + depending on RR, cannot propositionally represent communication/cognition
    + pragmatism (James)
        + you should evaluate your knowledge claims in terms of their efficaciousness
            + how much they make you adaptive to this world:
                + propositional grounded in procedural, which is grounded in perspectival, which is grounded in participatory
        + situating intellectual claims into lived/experienced/viable ability to fit
        + zeroing on relevant info (RR)
        + but: confusion between truth and relevance

#### 5 Criteria/features for Wisdom

+ which metaheuristics bring about excellence

1. rich factual knowledge about the fundamental pragmatics of life
    + sophia
2. rich procedural knowledge about the fundamental pragmatics of life
    + not *what* you know, but *how* you know
    + missing participatory and perspectival knowings
3. life-span contextualism
    + kind of perspectival knowing: zooming in and out (capacity for self-regulation)
4. relativism to values and priorities
    + criticism:
        + Socrates, Plato, Buddha, Jesus were not moral relativists
        + liberal democratic values are not fully constitutive of wisdom
    + proposal: capacity for tolerance
        + *fallibilism*: never assert certainty (Socrates)
        + *humility*: recognition of your limitations
5. recognition and management of uncertainty
    + finitary predicament: cannot do algorithmic processing, cannot pursue certainty
        + RR machinery

#### Metaheuristic

+ optimizes/coordinates between heuristics
    + eg. compression vs particularization
+ cognition is flexible to adapt itself to different situations

#### Empirical Evidence

+ put people in difficult situations, see how they describe solutions
+ measuring the *judicial* cognitive style (being good at making judgements)
+ experiment: task solving under 3 conditions
    1. discuss the problem with a significant other
    2. imagine a virtual/inner dialogue
    3. think more time
+ results: group 1-2 outperform 3
    + you are wiser is you talk to other people
    + questions the mythology of complete individualism
    + no significant difference between group 1 and 2
        + *Salomon effect*: describing *my* problem in a 3rd person perspective leads to insight
