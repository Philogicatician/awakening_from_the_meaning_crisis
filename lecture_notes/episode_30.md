# Episode 30 - Relevance Realization Meets Dynamical Systems Theory

### Explanation/theory of relevance has to
+ be scale invariant (attention scaling)
+ account for self-organization, self-correction, self-transcendence (insight)
+ be internal to the RR system --> to protect self-organization
--> RR and life are connected

### Why is the scientific theory of relevance impossible ?
how science works ? phil of science
+ generating inductive generalizations
+ studying things ("a type") ---> make predictions about them (about that type)
+ J.S. Mill: we need systematic import for inductive generalizations
     + sys import: properties that belong to all instances to the category
     + --> possible to make predictions / inductive generalizations about them
 
### Categories
+ properties for categories to make powerful (reliable and broad) inductive generalizations / have scientific explanation
    + homogeneous: to be able to extend the generalization**
    + stable: what's in the category should not be shifting (not members, but kind)
          + avoid equivocation, eg. equivocation
    + intrinsic, inherent
         + vs. relational, attributed (money, bottle - how we use them)

### **2 types of categories (Wittgenstein, Quine)
+ have essence (necessary & sufficient conditions <-- Aristotle): gold, horse, triangle
     - deductive essence: triangle (math category)
+ don't have essence: table, chair, game, money, white things, tuesdayness
     - still real categories
--> science should discover/give us inductive essences; i.e gold
--> scientific theory should make inductive generalizations
--> it is not possible to do science on categories that do not have essence
     + things exist that we cannot scientifically investigate
     + the prop "white things exist in this room" is true

### Relevance
+ no systematic import, no essence:
  + not homogeneous: they do not share common things
  + not stable
         + always changes what's relevant
         + maybe oxygen ?
  + no intrinsic/inherent properties
+ relevant is always relational
+ always relevant to an autopoietic/living thing (system capable of self-organizing, maintaining itself)
    + that need sth for survival, self-organization
--> no sci theory for relevance

## Theory of RR
new criteria:
    + relevance cannot be detected (empiricism)
    + relevance is not projected (romanticism)

Analogy of theory of R vs theory of RR
+ Aristotle: theory of systems
+ before Darwin: clergymen studying the natural world
     + hoping to understand the essence of how things are designed --> gives us insight into the mind of God
+ Darwin:
+ things donâ€™t have an essential design
+ fitness vs fittedness
     + fitness: capacity to survive long enough to propagate species
     + fittedness: what is it about the organism that allows it to survive long enough to reproduce
           + no essential design of fittedness: some things are fitted because they are big, small, long-, short-lived, fast, slow, etc.
           + environment is complex and dynamically changes: niches of fitting are varied and constantly changing
           +  no theory of fittedness, no essential design   
+ need a theory about what is relevant, how an organism is fitted, constantly being designed, redefined by a dynamic process
     + fittedness always redefining itself, constantly in a process of self-organization <-- no essence
     + constantly adapting to the way the world is changing
 + theory of how fittedness is constantly realized --> theory of the evolution of fittedness
     + feedback cycle of reproduction: virtual engine of selection and variation
           + no intelligent design: it is self-organizing, constantly evolving
           + fittedness and the evolution of fittedness are the same thing
 + Darwin proposed the first dynamic systems theory of how fittedness evolves: theory of evolution by natural selection
      + self-organizing process
      + non-circular/homoncular
      + generates intelligence without being an intelligent process

### Analogy of Relevance (R) and Fittedness (F)
no theory of fittedness ~ no theory of relevance
instead:
theory of the evolution of fittedness ~ theory of RR

+ R is analogous to biological fittedness
+ R is cognitive interactional fittedness
+ do not need a theory of F/F
+ need a theory of how F/R evolves
+ R: ability to constrain search/problem space:
      + formulate problems
      + form categories
      + pick up on conveyance
      + make inferences
+ role of systematic constraints:
    + regulate the sensory-motor feedback loop:
         * sensing-acting/moving
+ virtual engine that regulates the sensory-motor loop --> evolving its cognitive-interactional fittedness to the env
    + no final/essential framing of the env
--> need a theory of RR
+ how RR is effecting, shaping the sensory-motor loop
+ need a set of sub-semantic(truth)/syntactic(validity)**** properties --> to establish the agent-arena participation
      + bio-economic property***
+ process
     + self-organizing
     + multi-scale
     + in an auto-poietic system
`****logical norms`

`***biology/body as an economy`
+ economy is a self-organizing sys dealing with the distro of goods/services/time/energy/resources
+ distribution serves the goal of preserving the system
+ multi-scale: work locally and globally
+ regulated by logistical norms
+ (governing: selecting constraints)
+ (generated: enabling constraints)
+ logistics: proper use of resources, norms:
    + efficiency
    + resiliency: long term efficiency
+ RR is an ongoing evolution of our cognitive evolutionary fittedness
    + where a virtual engine is regulating the sensory-motor loop (dynamic sensing-acting/moving)
    + by regulating the bio-economy in terms of logistical norms (efficiency, resiliency)
+ R still does not have propsitional properties
+ self-organization & logistical norms governing the bio-economy
    + the bio-economy is organized to function on many scales of analysis (multi-scalar way)
    + eg. autonomous nervous system (ANS)
        + responsible for the level of arousal: how much metabolic resource is converted to (inter)action
            + low: falling asleep
            + high: running from a tiger
    + no final level/design
    + sympathetic nervous system (S): biased, looking for evidence raising the level of arousa
    + parasympathetic nervous system (P): biased, looking for evidence lowering the level of arousal
    + S and P are opposed
    + S and P are interdependent, integrated in their function
    + --> opponent processing: level of arousal is constantly evolving to fit the env
    + not perfect, but an optimization process --> self-organizing
        + the embedded brain uses opponent processing in a multi.scalar way to regulate the bio-economy, so that it constantly optimizes the cognitive fittednes to the env
+ virtual engine of efficiency vs resiliency: tradeoff relationship
    + commercial analogy:
        + more efficient business: most profit for least labor cost - selective constraint
            + no redundancy --> error propagates too fast
        + more resilient business: some redundancy to pick up the slack - enabling constraint
