# Episode 07 - Aristotle's Worldview and Erich Fromm

## Recap

+ your sense of growth/development is constitutive of the meaningfulness of your life
+ growth: idos is being in-formed
    + in-formation: actualizing the potential of sth
+ wisdom is a cultivation of character
    + create a virtual-engine that regulates the self-making, so that you actualize your potential
    + moving up the hierarchy and becoming a rational being
 + foolishness: when you have not cultivated your character:
    + know what is the right thing, but do the wrong thing (akrasia)

## Rationality

+ != logic
+ second order thinking: step back, and reflect on
    + how you are being self-deceptive, delusive
    + capacity for self-correction, and self-transcendence
        + realizing your potential through cultivation of character
+ contact with reality (<-- Plato, the other meta-drive)
    + core motivation of rationality with reliable means

### Theory of Knowing - Conformity Theory

#### What it is to know sth ?

Which is better ? 
+ accurate description of sth
+ vs be-cause (create, make) sth

What is it that the maker has that the descriptor does not ? 
+ the maker has idos/structural-functional organization in his mind
+ the maker can actualize the idos to make the thing

> To know sth is to possess the same idos of it in the mind.

+ not the same matter but the same form
+ **con-formity**
    + when I know sth I share the same form with it
    + my mind takes on the same idos as the thing
    + taking that idos out of my mind, I could actualize that thing, make an instance of it, be-cause it
+ eg. to know a cup
    + describe its shape (as an analogy of form) independently
        + having beliefs
    + or to con-form to the cup
        + grasp it, and take its shape, change in my being
        + causally interact with it in an intimate, complex way
+ con-formity: no distinction between knowing and being
    + my structure is being changed by knowing
+ conformity theory: contact epistemology:
    + to know sth is to be in contact with it
    + to know st is to participate in the same form
        + **participatory knowing**:
            +  when I shape myself in order to know it
            + to know it by conforming to it
        + different from **propositional/descriptive knowing**
            + standing apart and generating propositions about the thing
    + intimate connection between mind and reality
        + contact/participatory knowing is central to how cognition works
    + theory of knowing and being at the same time
        + satisfies the desire to being in contact with reality

The structural-functional organization / patterns of intelligibility (<-- Plato) is the same pattern by which the thing is organized. 

+ when making sense of sth I share the same structural-functional organization of what I1m making sense of
    + when making sense of things, the pattern in the mind is the same as in the pattern in the world
+ but: not everything I think is true
    + only after doing the axial/Socratic/Platonic rational reflection we get to idos/structural-functional organization

Process/test of trying to determine whether st is real

1. relevant organ of cognition is functioning normally; mind operating optimally
2. env is not creating distortions; medium operating optimally
3. convergence of multiple sources/senses; intersubjective agreement

+ if 1-3. holds, you are in conformity with reality
    + the pattern in your mind is the pattern in the world
+ (not true ultimately, but the method is scientific)

## Structure of Reality

### Worldview

+ geocentric worldview
    + we are at the center
    + counter argument against the Earth rotating theory:
        + if I drop sth, it falls down, not flying away (<-- no theo of gravitation yet)
        + not true, but logical argument
    + supported by the conformity theory
+ things move for the same reason you move
    + things is moving themselves against me
    + natural motion
         + everything is moving to its natural place
    + internal drive
    + everything in the cosmos is moving on purpose, meaningfully
+ things are made up of 3 basic elements:
    + earth
        + things with much earth elements want to move to the earth/doen
    + water
        + in the surface
    + fire
        + moves up
    + air
        + is above

con-formity theory | geocentric world/cosmos
--- | ---
knowing-being |
knowing how to make sth |
3 tests | this is the intelligible pattern, evidence
agent | arena

+ con-formity theory and geocentric world/cosmos mutually support each other
    + con-formity theory and tests (tof rational reflection) supports the geocentric view
    + geocentric world/cosmos provides evidence for the con-formity theo
+ your understanding of your understanding is bound to the understanding of the world
    + account of how you know the world bound with the account of the world
+ --> new worldview

#### Features of A's worldview

+ makes sense of your actions
+ world organized according to purpose
+ things are moving on purpose to where they belong
+ structure of the world ~= structure of your experience
+ this world is an **arena**: place where you know how to act in it
    + makes sense to you
    + you know where things belong
    + you know what actions are appropriate
    + you know how to measure and calibrate your performance/actions
    + eg. football player in the arena can con-form (behave and inteact) powerfully
+ **agent**: to be capable of pursuing your goals
     + to be able to organize your cognition and behavior so that your actions fit the situ/env
+ a worldview is to have an agent-arena coupling
    + A explains how to become an agent: how to know and structure yourself accordingly
    + A explains how the world is organized, so that you can meaningfully interact with it
    + --> process of **co-identification**
        + e.g. professional football player in the arena

#### Co-Identification

+ assuming an identity
    + eg. someone giving a talk
+ assigning an identity of everything around me
    + eg. the audience, things facilitation the giving of a talk
+ assigning arena and assuming identity are co-defining together
+ co-identifying agenca nad arena: **existential mode** (Geertz, Buber, Fromm, explaining (not) religion)
    + getting a coherent and functioning worldview
    + **meta-meaning** relations
        + if you don't have an agent arena relationship, your actions have no meaning (eg. tennis player in a football arena)
        + the existential mode makes possible an entire system of meanings
        + instance of enacting a worldview relationship

> Your existential mode is being a meta-meaning relationship, and is an instance of enacting this worldview relationship.

 + the process of unfolding this: **worldview attunement**

#### Worldview Attunement

+ your existential mode, the way in which you are creating co-identifications of agent-arena, fit into a process of worldview attunement
+ if you don't have a worldview (attunement), you would experience your experience as absurd
    + eg. tennis player in the football arena
    + one aspect of the meaning crisis: people experience their existence as absurd
+ meta-meaning/existential mode that affords a functioning worldview attunement
    + gives way in which co-creates agent-arena relationship

> A. has given us a connection between our projects of understanding the world and our existential projects of belonging in a meaningful fashion.

+ we don't find that connection today:
    + scientific worldview does not give us existential guidance of how to make our lives more meaningful

#### Nomological Order

> To have a worldview that is demonstrating a worldview attunement, and it is affording existential modes in which agent-arena relationships are unfolding and blossoming naturally, so that the person is not experiencing absurdity.

+ deep connectedness of making sense of the world and the existential project of finding meaning and belonging
+ nomos: law
     + what makes the universe law-like, so that it is a cosmos for us
+ convergence of scientific explanations of the world and our endeavours to existentially dwell within it
+ if the nomological order breaks down, we start experience absurdity
    + lose the sense of belonging

The axial age heritage on meaning is to have a nomological order. 
+ a meaningful life:
    + situated in a nomological order, that is reliably generating
        + existential modes that are consonant with our
        + best scientific understanding

## Axial Revolution in India (Fromm)

+ coinage
+ literacy

### Mindfulness

+ psychotechnology
+ historical/cultural factors generated it
    + Karen Armstrong - The Great Transformation: The Beginning of Our Religious Traditions

### The Myth of Siddharta

+ living in the palace, having everything
+ leaves the palace

### Existential Modes

existential mode | having mode | being mode
--- | --- | ---
needs | having needs | being needs
relating to things | categorically | expressively
interaction | control, manipulate | reciprocal realization
relationship | `I-it` | `I-thou`
achieved by | intelligence | reason
goal | problem solving | make meaning

#### Having Mode - The Palace

+ existential mode
+ having needs
    + needs being met by having sth
    + categorizing things; categorical understanding
    + efficiently control, manipulate them
    + `I-it` relationship (Buber)
        + identity from belonging to a category
+ Marcus Aurelius: "It is possible to be happy even in the palace."
    + Stoic/axial is antithetical to palace life
+ having mode is not inherently bad:
    + you need to have water, oxygen, etc.

#### Being Mode

+ existential mode
+ being needs
    + met by becoming sth
        + you need to become mature
    + developmental needs
    + related to the meaning that you are creating for your existence
+ relating to things expressively
    + eg. being in love:
        + trying to become sth and afford the other become sth
        + meeting your needs of meaning, maturity, growth, development
        + mutual development, mutual/reciprocal realization (~ anagoge)

#### Modal Confusion

+ satisfy our being needs by the having mode
+ living in the palace: trying to live by the having mode only
    + `becoming` mature by `having` a car
    + consumerism, market world:
        + being need not satisfied by having mode --> buy/pursue more
