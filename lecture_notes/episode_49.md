# Episode 49 - Corbin and Jung

## Recap

+ Heidegger and Eckhart: a non-teleological relationship to the play of being
    + *dasein*: the being whose being is in question
        + where self-knowledge and knowledge of the world are bound up
+ Corbin: gnosis/serious play relates to the imagination
    + *imaginary* vs *imaginal*
        + imaginary: subjective mental images
        + **imaginal**: transjectively mediating between the abstract-intelligible world and concrete-sensible world
            + ongoing transformative transframing
            + **symbol** captures this:
                + Corbin's core symbol relating to gnosis and to Heidegger's *dasein*: *the angel*
+ the symbol of *the angel*
    + incorporating Heidegger and Persian Sufism
    + historical work shows that throughout the Hellenistic period there is the pursuit of the **divine double**
    + transgressive (retrospectively ?) wrt the decadent Romantic notion of the *true self* with which we are born, and which we need to express (Rousseau);
        + true virtue is authenticity: being true to the true self, that you *have/possess**
        + as opposed to the Socratic model of aspiring to the true self
    + the transgressive mythology is that the *true self* is the *divine double*
        + bound to me, but superlative to me (super: above; grammar..)
        + existential project is to *transcending* the self (not simply *expressing* it), and become a self that is ecstatically ahead of you
    + the question is: what's in there for so many people (in the symbol of angel)

## Transformative Experience

+ L.A. Paul: transformation is insight
+ A. Callard: transformation through aspiration is developmental
    + development is a linked sequence of insights that bring about qualitative change in competence

### The Arpirational Process

+ connection between **aspiration** and **rationality**
    + aspiration is part of the rational process
    + eg. liberal education is an aspirational process
    + *proleptic* rationality
    + rejoining of **love** and **reason**
+ **non-logical identity** between `self1` and `self2`
    + `self1`: doesn't *appreciate* classical music, doesn't have the taste for it
        + but wants to be somebody who does
        + currently ignorant of the perspectival/participatory knowing that is required for it
        + aspiration is not about satisfying current desires (eg. impressing others)
    + `self2`: *appreciates* classical music because of perspectival/participatory knowing

#### Strawson: Paradox of Self-Creation

+ **self**
    + *continuity requirement* between `self1` and `self2`
        + `self1 == self2`
    + `self1` is responsible for `self2`
+ **creation**
    + *real novelty* between `self1` and `self2`
        + qualitative development
            + not quantitative, eg. improving a skill
+ self-creation is paradoxical, self-contradictory
    + eg. Fodor: you cannot create a stronger logic by logically manipulating a weaker logic
        + have to introduce axioms that are outside the system
    + in order to get real novelty between `self1` and `self2`, I have to introduce sth that's outside the logic of `self1`
        + but outside/foreign is not an act of self-creation
    + you cannot *infer* your way from `self1` to `self2`
        + Kierkegaard: *leap of faith*
+ solutions:
    1. __empiricism__: there is no self, just a blank slate
    2. __romanticism__: self is identical throughout, I'm just expressing what was already within myself

#### Callard's Critique of the Paradox of Self-Creation

+ the relationship between `self1` and `self2` is one of *non-logical identity*
    + we practice this by engaging in **narrative**
    + romantic *expressionism*/activity and empiricist *writing-on-the-blank-slate* does not capture this/passivity
+ `self1` does not *make* or *receive* `self2`, but **participates** in `self2`'s **emergence**
    + `self2` **emerges** out of `self1` to the point that `self1` **disappears** into `self2`
    + this is the process of *aspiration*

#### Causation between `self1` and `self2`

+ remaining problem:
    + `self1` is **temporally prior** to `self2`
    + but: `self2` *causes* `self1` 
        + `self2` is **normatively primary**
        + `self1` normatively depends on `self2`
        + `self2` justifies/explains `self1`'s actions
+ the mythos of the *divine double* implies that `self2` somehow pre-exists
    + teleological explanation
        + not always helpful
+ `self1` has the causal power, but `self2` has the normative authority
    + aspiring to be like Socrates
    + the representation of `self2` has to afford becoming it
    + Corbin: **imaginal symbol** does this
+ __imaginal symbol__:
    + non-logical identity
    + participatory representation: affording the transformative process
+ my representation of the *aspired self* is a *symbolic self* that I can internalize into my current self **anagogically**
    + we transcend ourselves by internalizing others' perspectives
    + it becomes part of your metacognition
+ *anagogic* process:
    1. internalizing the symbolic self: reorganizing my psyche
    2. so that I see different ways of being in the world
    3. as I inhabit the new ways of being in the world, they allow me to re-internalize
    4. repeat 1-3. - the anagogic process is taking off on its own accord
        + transcending making/receiving: *participating*

#### The Divine Double

+ the *divine double* captures this dynamic/anagogic process
    + but simplifies it into a linear narrative/teleological process
        + teleology does not capture the participatory aspect
        + overemphasizing the passive receptivity of `self1`
    + **inkling** required
+ the *divine double* **shines** the *greater frame* into the *current frame*
    + and **withdraws** into the *greater frame*
    + transframing (RR), gnosis, self-transcendence, transjective (not subjective, nor objective)
+ the *divine double* is an example of the *imaginal*, represented in the mythos of angels
    + affording the **being mode**: becoming someone
+ Corbin: everything has an angel: __angelic order of being__
    + agent and arena a mutually transformed
    + every object is *shining* and *withdrawing* into its mystery
    + everything is a *thing beyond itself*
+ as the divine double binds too much to the mythoa/narratives/theism,
    + it is better to use a non-theistic representation: the *sacred second self*

## Jung

+ influence of Corbin not always credited
+ book: Modern Man in Search of A Soul

### Soul

+ the *sacred second self* is the *soul* that you are *becoming/aspiring*
+ response to the MC: modern man has lost his soul
    + loss of a real relationship to the *sacred second self*, that is needed for responding to the MC

#### Individuation

+ process of development/self-transformation/responding to MC
+ picking up on the processes within the psyche: **psychology**
+ **individuation** is a psychological process:
    + contrast with __Freud__:
        + notion of **unconscious**
        + nature *and* nurture: interaction
        + stages of development
        + Ricour, Storr:
            + Freud has a **hydraulic model** of the psyche
                + pressures, drives, pushes; steam has to come out
+ Jung's model of the psyche:
    + **organic model**: psyche as a self-organizing dynamical system
        + *auto-poietic*
+ **archetypes**: arche typos
    + from Plato's *form/idos*: structural-functional organization
    + formative founding patterns of the psyche
    + not images
        + treating images in an *imaginal* fashion
        + leading you into the *aspirational* process of *individuation*
    + **systems of constraints**
        + *virtual engines* regulating the self-organization of what is *salient* to us
        + eg. if the *hero* archetype is activated in me:
            + my salience landscape is transformed anagogically
            + undergoing aspirational self-transformation of becoming more *heroic*
    + *auto-poietic*
        + the way the psyche makes itself as a *living* organism

```
ego
 |
 |
imaginal
 |
 |
Self
```

+ **ego** is the archetype of the **conscious mind**
+ **Self** is the *sacred second self*
    + the idos of the idos / archetype of the archetypes
    + the virtual engine regulating the self-organization of the psyche as a whole
    + functioning and developing merged
        + aspirational
+ interaction between the archetypes
    + internalized into the ego's self-organization
+ dialogue between the *ego* and *Self* (through the *archetypes*): **axis mundi**
    + the ego's perpectival/participatory knowing is altered: *individuation* of the ego
+ criticism of fundamentalism/literalism:
    + reducing the *imaginal* nature of archetypes into *imaginary*
    + losing the *being mode*
    + inflation of the ego: *having* an identity instead of *becoming* through *individuation*

### Criticism of Jung

+ Corbin, Buber (`I-it` vs `I-thou`):
    + Jung is too *intra-psychic* (except for llate work)
        + too *subjective* (Kantian heritage): everything is happening within the mind
            + not *transjective*
        + missing the *existential modes*
        + reducing the imaginal to the imaginary:
            + the mystical discloses the depths of the psyche and world simultaneously

#### Jung's Fictional Criticism of Corbin/Heidegger

+ missing psychology:
    + how does the existential/ontological/Neoplatonic process play out in the psyche
    + how does the *imaginal* get *internalized* into the psyche

#### Vervaeke's Suggestion

+ integrate Corbin, Jung, Buber
