# Episode 34 - Sacredness: Horror, Music, and the Symbol

## Recap

+ central features of human spirituality
    + RR explains many of them
    + religio: term that covers them
    + missing account of the sacred
+ distinction between the __metaphysical proposal__ of the experience
of *sacred(ness)* and the __psycho-existential proposal__ of
*sacredness*
+ functions of *sacredness*:
     + protect from domicide; re-home us
     + meta-meaning system that affords worldview attunement
+ gnosticism: a transgressive response to domicide
    + another aspect of *sacredness*
        + idea of the *Holy* --> *numinous* (Otto)
            + pre-moral view/aspect of *sacredness*: God is glorious
(shining & powerful); see book of Job

## Sacredness as Numinous (Otto)

+ numinous is transgressive
    1. it is a mystery (sensibility transcendence, trajectory of
transframing, eg. mother-of-law)
        a. fascinating (super-salient); flow state
        b. horror
            + your sense of contact with reality is being challenged, undermined
            + insanity, madness
            + monsters: inter-categorical features (Mary Douglas)
                + unclean animals in the Bible:
shape-location-locomotion do not match (eg. crocodiles, shellfish -
live in the sea but no fish shape); broken pattern/purity code
                + violate our core categorical ways of making sense of the world
                + if threatening & between important categories -->
invokes horror
                + eg. wolfman: inter-categorical between beastial and personal
                + eg. ghost: inter-categorical between living and dead
                + eg. vampire: inter-categorical between living and
dead; living, consume but not produce
                + eg. zombie: inter-categorical between living and dead

#### Horror

+ losing the optimal grip on reality
    + (eg. Kubrick: Shining)
    + insanity
+ continuum between weirdness and genuine horror
+ shakes the structure of our worldview
+ eg. people slowing down at an accident site hoping to see horror/death
    + fascinated, compelled
    + confrontation with death has the possibility to sever your grip on reality
+ mystery is missing from horror
    + because we lose the grip/sense of reality
    + no insight like in wonder
    + fast shock
+ "shadow" of flow
    + seeking to be deeply coupled, but it is not happening
    + no stable relationship with reality
+ Old Testament God: super-salient, sometimes horrifying
    + fear/awe of/for God (*awe*some/ful) - *awe* borders on horror

> Sacredness draws us into the boundary of awe and horror where we are forced to into a situation of confrontation with a demand to change.

+ sacredness should take us to the horizon on intelligibility/making
sense of the world
+ overlap with HSC:
    + being more real
    + demand us to accommodate our framing
+ horror: pushing us to our limits:
    + realization that we are limited, mortal, insufficient --> humility
    + no matter how much we grow we can't encompass the mystery
    + prevent inflation
    + remind/remember humility
+ contact/confrontation with sth much greater than yourself

#### The Two Faces of Sacredness

sacredness | sacredness
--- | ---
worldview attunement | numinous
homes us against horror | expose/fascinate us with horror
meta-assimilation | meta-accommodation
agent-arena fit |

+ opponent processing
+ higher order RR
    + pushing down the levels of knowing into your existential modes
    + into the depths of agent-arena relationship
    + then opening up again
+ serious play with the machinery of RR --> optimization
    + connection to world, mind, body

#### Music and Sacredness

+ music is not about anything in a referential/conceptual sense
+ playing with the machinery of salience landscaping for its own sake
+ perspectival: salience landscape
+ participatory: embody the rhythm, etc.

## Role of Symbols in Sacredness

+ symbols invoke/activate/play with the machinery of sacredness
+ symbol etymology: put two things together
+ symbol vs sign:
    + sign: reference; look through it to look at sth else
    + symbol: refer & exemplify: invoking participatory knowing
        + serious play with the machinery in the agent-arena relationship
        + eg. kissing someone: participate in love (not just think of
it), reciprocal realization, rembering the being mode together
        + symbols have a metaphor at their core

### Metaphor and Symbols

+ Lakoff & Johnson; Barfield
+ much of our cognition is structured by metaphor
+ two domains: look through the *source* domain at the *target* domain
+ salience topography of the target is altered
+ insight into the target

metaphor | target | source
--- | --- | ---
Sam is a pig. | Sam/human | pig/animal
Halfway through the lecture. | lecture | space

#### Criticism of Lakoff

+ the embodied/participatory/source domain/project gets *projected* up
into target/abstract thought

Metaphor | abstract/target | physical/source
--- | --- | ---
He attacked my argument | argumentation | war
 | argument | attack
pneuma | spirit |  wind/breath

+ metaphor is not just a projection
     + not a simple identity relation
+ replacing synonyms does not work:

noun/verb | attack | assault | criticize
--- | --- | --- | ---
argument | ok | NA | ok
castle | ok | ok | NA

+ source/physical and target/conceptual point to each other:
    + bottom up projection (physical --> conceptual), top down
emanation (conceptual --> physical)
    + interaction, dynamic process
+ do you `see/get/grasp/understand` *my point*
    + the target (*my point*) selects/constraints for the source

#### Symbol processing

+ reference --> exemplification --> participation --> metaphor -->
profoundity --> **holding in mind**
+ eg. justice
    + to reflect/contemplate it we invoke the symbol of a scale --> *balance*
        + allows us to hold justice in mind and engage/participate in it
+ the brain is a self-exaptation machine (both evolutionary and developmentally)
    + eg. tongue --> speech
    + __upward__ process: from physical to abstract/conceptual
    + side effects are a dynamic set of capacities that could be made
into a new structural-functional organization to do a new thing
        + circuit reuse
        + side effects become central effects --> new capacity
    + eg. cerebellum; physical *balance* --> integrate different areas
of the brain
        + original function/operation: taking info from different
sense modalities, finding patterns of contingency
        + exapted function/operation: find coordination between any
areas of the brain
            + eg. integrate vision & working memory --> visual imagination
+ when invoking the symbol for justice, scale/balance, the brain goes
through a __downward__ process, and activates the cerebellum
    + going back through exaptation
    + symbol of justice --> balance --> cerebellum
    + symbols trace down to the physical/participatory level, help to
get a grip on the conceptual domain
    + not a simple bottom-up projection, also a top-down guidance
+ the symbol is participatory
    + hold in mind & go back down
    + participation in the activation of the cognitive machinery & bring it up
    + to insight
