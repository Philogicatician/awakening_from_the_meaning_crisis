# Episode 38 - Agape and 4E Cognitive Science

## Recap

### Features of Religo & Perennial Problems (PPs)

#### Reverse Engineering Enlightenment

+ PPs are endemic to us because of the structuring & functioning of
the adaptive religio
    + the processes that make us intelligently adaptive, also make us
vulnerable to self-deception/destruction
+ addressing PPs:

religio feature type | religio feature | respective PP | practice(s) to address the PPs
--- | --- | --- | ---
functional | self-organization | parasitic processing | counteractive dynamical system
functional | self-identification | modal confusion | cultivation of sati
functional | self-reflection | reflectiveness gap | cultivation of flow
structural | self's connection to the world | absurdity | cultivating prajna/scientia intuitiva
structural | self's connection to self | anxiety | cultivating inner dialogue, internalization & indwelling of the sage
structural | self's connection to others | alienation | engage in communitas
developmental |  | existential entrapment | cultivating gnosis, HSC, therapy

## Wisdom Framing

+ HSC --> gnosis --> counteractive dynamical system (eg. eightfold path)
    + cultivating:
        + sati
        + prajna
        + flow
        + inner dialogue
        + communitas
+ reliable response of amelioration/alleviation of PPs
    + --> "enlightenment"
+ we still need to articulate *wisdom* from a cogsci perspective:
    + what does wisdom mean ?
    + how do we cultivate wisdom ?
+ but: the project of *reverse engineering enlightenment* can be
undermined  if the ecology of practices cannot be situated in a
welcoming __worldview__
+ *ecology of practices* is necessary, but not suffiecient for
responding to the meaning crisis (MC)
    + need an integration with historocal forces

### PPs and the Historical Forces

+ historical forces lead to:
    + the loss of the 3 orders
    + *worldview mis-attunement*
+ proposal of a **Religion That's Not A Religion** (RTNAR)
    + like Tillich, Jung, Corbyn, Barfield

#### Interaction of the Loss of the 3 Orders with PPs

__Nomological__:

+ sense of coherence & connectedness
+ S. Wolf: *connectedness* as a metaphor (symbolic expression) for:
    + we want *subjective attraction* (ie. what we find salient) to
conform with *objective attractiveness* (ie. )
    + we know that objective attractiveness does not exist
        + shown by the sci revolution: no meaning/relevance in any
particular thing (<-- Kant)

> Historical forces prevent the legitimacy of the projects that deal/address with PPs.

+ __question__: do we need things to be objectively attractive/valuable ?
+ RR is inherently interested in/valuing itself because
    + it is constitutive of a
self-organizing/correcting/optimizing/developing process
    + it is constitutive of being agents that value other stuff too
+ transjectivity/bi-directionality of RR
    + RR is not in the self, not in the world
    + RR is emerging from the affordances that are co-created by the
self and the world
+ self needs to be *connected* to the *conditions that afford RR*
    + conditions that satisfy the valuing that RR is interested in itself
+ we *care* about the conditions that afford meaning making
    + universal conditions
+ *caring* about the conditions of *meaning making* that we find
*inherently valuable*: __agape__:
    + to love the process of meaning making itself for its own sake
+ process of meaning making == being a person
+ sense of being connected to other people agapically
+ __response__: cultivation of agape
    + the value of meaning making not objective, not subjective but
transjective --> transcendental
        + what I'm involved with are the conditions of the possibility
of meaning making itself
    + not just being directed to another mind/body, but also their
conditions/community/env/dev
    + preceds, permeates and follows us

+ counter practices to PPs has to be integrated with an agapic way of being
+ we have to care about the conditions that make caring possible
+ agape makes both the agent and arena possible
+ caring is not subjective/objective but transjective:
    + its value is independent of my valuing of it

__Normative__:

+ sense of significance & depth

__Narrative__:

+ sense of purpose & direction

__Worldview__:

+ historical forces
+ where we do not belong

## 3rd Generation/4E CogSci Addressing Historical Forces

+ Evan Thompson:Mind in Life
    + deep continuity hypothesis: continuity between the principles of
biology-cognition-dynamical systems

### F. Valera: Steps to a Science of Interbeing: Unfolding Implicit
the Dharma in Modern Cognitive Science

+ __question__: how does 4E cogsci address the 3 orders
+ resonance between cogsci and Buddhism
+ 4 insights:

#### 1. Embodiment

+ mind is not a software program, it arises though immediate *coping*
with the world
+ coping: ongoing/evolving fittedness
+ intelligence is the way we evolve the sensor-motor loop, so that we
deal with the problems at hand
+ remember the other kinds of knowing
+ continuity between embodied sensori-motor action and most abstract cognition
+ JV:
    + cognition is grounded in RR; RR is grounded in bio-economy
    + body is a bio-economy that *enacts* logistical norms of
*efficiency* and *resiliency*, that *constrain* cognition, so that it
evolves its fittedness to the world
     + continual **niche-construction** (D. Walsh):
         + the organism is shaping-and-selecting the environment, and
the env is shaping-and-selection the org (transjective loop)
         + eg. culture: shaping the env & shape ourselves to fit that env
         + eg. RR is niche construction:

~ Enactment

+ E. Thompson: cognition is sth we enact

~ Embeddedness

+ embodiment leads to embeddness
+ RR is niche construction:
+ RR tells us about the function/phenom of consciousness too
+ mind & body & world are in deep continuity
    + refuting Descartes

~ Extendedness

+ cognition is not just in the head but extended through
    + our interaction with the world
    + psychotechs
    + distributed cognition

#### 2. Emergence

 + `system > sum(parts)`
+ the mind emerges from the embodied/embedded brain coupled to the env
+ *complexification* is inherent in the RR machinery of religio
+ hierarchy of systems: normative order with a metaphysical backing
    + __self-organizing__: eg. tornado
    + __self-making__: eg. evolution
        + *autopoietic*
        + developmental
    + __self-identifying__: eg. humans
        + reflective of your self-making, developmental nature
+ does *bottom up emergence* need a *top down emanation* ?

#### 3. Emotion

+ deep divide between emotion and reason
    + Romantics vs Empiricists (Rousseau vs Locke)
+ Demasio: Descartes' Error
    + people disconnected from their emotions are incapacitated as
cognitive agents
    + without emotion/caring (RR: caring about info) we cannot *take
care* of ourselves
    + Without RR we face combinatorial explosion
+ being embodied -- being a RRer -- having emotion
+ emotion is a way in which RR is brought up into the level of
salience landscaping
    + emotions shape the salience landscaping --> agent-arena
relationship becomes obvious
    + eg. being angry: assuming a role, assigning identities, knowing what to do
+ JV: `religio == caring + coping`: core of cognitive agency
+ emotion is how we coordinate *attachment* such that we create
persons within communities

#### 4. Excellence

+ standard psychology: study how to mind breaks down to
    + analyze & understand its parts
    + help people fix it (therapy)
+ __positive psychology__: understand/study excelling/happy minds
    + how the mind transcend itself
+ happiness, meaning in life, wisdom
    + wisdom: excelling cognitive capacities for
        + coping & caring
        + noticing self-deception
        + dealing with PPs
        + how to use knowledge best

### Getting back the orders with CogSci

+ deep continuity/embodiment & emergence & development/excellence give
us back the __nomological order__:
    + we see how we (and our meaning making) fit/belong
+ __normative order__: what it is to self-transcend
    + best internal optimization & best external realization: affording anagoge
+ U. Goodenough: transcendence
    + challenging the axial cognitive grammar
    + transcendence *into the depth* of the psyche
+ __narrative order__:
    + cosmic *telos*
    + but: evolution and RR don't have telos --> they are open-ended
    + __question__: how to bring back the narrative order ?
    + __answer__: can't do it no way; think of NarOr as gnosis
        + open-ended optimization
    + indispensable need for symbols and stories to afford optimization:
        + these stories/symbols do not exists independently in the
structure of reality
    + want to avoid utopic visions and nostalgia
+ __post-narrative__ way of being:
    + not a grand purpose connected to the history of the cosmos
    + instead: beyond narrative way of conforming to reality; eg. as in HSC
+ no scientific mystery of HSC, but continuity of exaptation:
    + fluency --> insight --> flow --> mystical experience -->
transformative HSC
