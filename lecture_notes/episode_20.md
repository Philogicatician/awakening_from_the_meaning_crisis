# Episode 20 - Death of the Universe

## Recap

Changing:

+ psychotech of reading:
+ from participatory to consumption of info
+ knowledge:
+ from transformative conformity to the world to coherence between propositions

__Two worlds__:

+ **natural**: understood by reason
+ **supernatural**: understood by faith
+ love moves the will,
+ will asserts propositions to be true

## Meister Eckhart (1260-1328)

+ influenced by Neoplatonism
+ change in the normative order
    + Neoplatonism: anagoge, conformity to the world, ascent to self-transcendence, wisdom
    + Rheinland mystics: spirituality is God's descent to you
         + Augustine: will moves the love
         + Aquinas: love moves the will
             +  will becomes central to your spirituality
         + mystics: love is the way the will moves
             + love is self-negation, sacrifice
             + will negates itself
             + to make space so god can dwell in me
             + spirituality is a battle of wills (mine vs God's)
+ model of god ~ model of yourself

## Ockham (1287-1347)

+ __the source of God's being__
    + Augustine, Neoplatonism: **His reason**
          + love --> creativity
    + Ockham: **His will**
        + God's assertions create
        + ascent through reason is gone
        + any order in existence is god'ss arbitrary will
        + god speaks the world into existence
* whatever pattern/category (eg. book) you find, you are making it by speaking about it, not by reasoning about it --> nominalism
* patterns are not actually there
* knowledge is just in the head, the way I'm using the language
* there is no order in the world --> the world is absurd, not intellegible in itself
* supernatural world is not reason or rational order

+ love/spirituality is self-sacrifice, self-negation of will
+ only patterns/order in the world is how we speak about them

## Bubonic Plague

+ end of the world
+ broken social structures
+ order given given/taken by god arbitrarily (power is arbitrary)

### Beginnings of Commercialism

+ labor shortage
+ people freely move
+ changing status by selling labor
+ change your life through your own efforts
+ making money by moving stuff around
+ disparity-demand

### New Psychotechs

+ processing info better:
+ Arabic numbers,
+ negative numbers,
+ celestial navigation
+ Aristotelian way of thinking

#### New Secular Institutions

+ banks
+ insurance companies
+ corporations

## Copernicus

> The math is better if we put the Sun in the center.

### What Is Real ?

+ __Aristotle__:
    1. relevant (sense) organ is functioning
    2. medium is not distorted 
    3. there is an agreement by rational discussion
    + being in *conformity/touch* with the world
+ __Copernicus__: 1-3 is not enough
    + *world-mind* separation
    + sensory experience is not enough
    + everything is an illusion
        + "How do you know that this table is here?"
        + "How do you know that your mother actually loved you?"
    + loss of participatory knowing
    + disconnection from the world

## Galileo

+ our perception deceives us
    + can't trust sensory experience
+ new scientific way:
    + Aristotelian logic &
    + new math &
    + careful observation
+ overcoming illusion and self-deception
+ math is the language of the universe
    + until then: geometry
    + new stuff: arithmetic, calculation
+ use geometry in an abstract sense
    + triangle to represent the relationship between distance and time
+ Galileo kills the universe:
    + inertial motion
    + no inner drive, purpose
    + **matter is dead**
+ the world is not purposeful
+ human is a little island
    + alone in a vast desert of **purposelessness**
    + matter **resists my will**
        + world pushes back on me
    + will vs resistance to will
+ mathematical properties are real, everything else is illusion

#### What is evil, then ?

+ __before__: pure being of chaos
+ __after__: evil just inert matter
	+ or excessive immorality

#### Scientific method

+ mathematical measures are real/**objective**
+ non-math stuff (sunset, sweetness, meaning) is **subjective**:
	+ in the mind, experience

#### Meaning Crisis

__World__:

+ is unordered, inert chaos, absurdity, indifferent

__I__:

+ am a battle of wills
	+ our purposes are not real/meaningful
	+ we are just atoms
	+ trauma, stress, crisis: disconnection from the world

Dissolution of the axes of meaning

+ nomological, normative, narrative orders
