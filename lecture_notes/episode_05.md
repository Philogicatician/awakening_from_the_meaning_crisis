# Episode 05 - Plato and the Cave


## Recap

+ axial age in Greece: meaning, wisdom and self-transcendence are bound
+ Pythagoras
+ Socrates:
    + dilemma from the gods vs being wise
    + wisdom: salience and truth are coupled
    + method: show uncoupledness, how we are subject to self-deception
    + dying for the examined life worth living

## Plato

+ pythagorean training
+ his writings are an inexhaustible fount for JV and others:
    + sacred: what is transformative (!= supernatural)
    + (Neo-)Platonism is a bedrock for Western spirituality

### Theory of foolishness

+ Plato traumatized by the death of Socrates:
    + inner conflict/dilemma:
        + his beloved Athens kills his beloved Socrates
+ 2-world mythology to explain
    + illusionary/everyday/lower vs real world (in a metaphorical sense)
    + differing from the Old Testament:
        + historical view: things are fallen now, but moving to the Promised Land
    + Plato gives a scientific answer of the 2-world / why humans are foolish: 1st psychological theory

### Workings of inner conflict (CogSci explanation)

> When you have two strong motives that seem to be working against each other. When weâ€™re divided against ourselves in an important way.
We feel most distraught, most anxious, or the most sense of being stuck when we have such inner conflict.

+ dieting
    + solution: join a group
+ procrastination
+ why we are so prone to bullshit, self-deception/destruction
+ why we don't do what we think we should

#### Plato's theory: different parts/centers of the psyche

+ monster:
    + motivated by pleasure and pain, salience
    + very adaptive: reproduction, danger
    + works by superficial properties, salience
+ lion:
    + motivated by respect and shame
+ man:
    + motivated by truth
    + works by in-depth analysis

Animal | Organ | Represents  | Conflict | Domain/Scope | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Monster | genitals, stomach |  appetite | pleasure vs pain | immediate goals | sallence (adaptive)
Lion | chest, emotions (pride) | thymos (~spirit) | respect vs shame | mid term-goals | participation, honored social animal, peer pressure (adaptive), distributed cognition
Man | head | reason | truth vs false | long-term goals | understanding

Lot of potential conflict in the system:

+ monster and man opposing each other (salience vs truth)
    + the monster is racing ahead of what we understand
    + salience exceeds understanding: we are perpetually vulnerable
+ what helps: lion
    + joining groups (eg. study group against procrastination)
    + we are social creatures
    + we want to feel respected/honored by our peers
        + shame: losing respect of peers
    + cooperation with other people
        + mid-term, socially agreed upon shared goals
        + shared, cultural meaning of your experience (eg. share new food with others)
        + distributed cognition: helps improving cognitive power over the world
            + very adaptive; humans can kill everything on the world

The goal is to have the system properly ordered:

+ salience, participation, understanding should be in sync, otherwise:
    + inner conflict, that leads to
        + self-deception
        + self-centeredness: egocentricity, selfishness (<--- when inner conflict is anxiety <-- threat signal --> adaptivity)

#### Hyperbolic/temporal discounting (CogSci)

> Discounting is how much you are reducing the salience of a stimulus. The more you discount the less salient something is, the less it stands out for you, the less it grabs your attention.

+ universal among groups of humans, even other species
+ cartesian graph:
    + horizontal (x) axis: time (or probability?)
    + vertical (y) axis: discounting
+ a stimulus is losing salience over time: very adaptive
+ things in the future have less saliece
     + eg. dying from lung cancer as a consequence of smoking
+ less probable thing are less salient: also very adaptive
     + forking probabilities
     + eg. anxiety finds things salient that are not salient/probable --> crippling (not adaptive)

Hyperbolic discounting blinds us to less salient, but important things.

+ adaptive, but also makes up prone to self-deception, self-destruction
+ meaning and wisdom have to wrestle with unavoidable reality
+ can't throw away the whole machinery, because it is adaptive

#### Plato's solution for inner conflict

+ the man can learn, is capable of abstract thought, but also is weak
    + and that's ok, because we cannot turn off the salience machinery, that would kill us
+ the lion is not capable of theory, but can be trained by reason/man
    + using the Socratic method: dialogos
    + bringing reason to the social arena
    + social interaction & rational reflection
+ the man and the lion together can tame the monster

This process (teaching of the man, the training of the lion and the taming of the monster) reduces inner conflict.
+ Plato's wisdom: justice between the 3 centers of psyche
+ optimization strategy: right coordination between the 3 parts:
    + each can live as much as possible, without putting the other 2 in danger
+ inner justice, wisdom realization, fullness of being
+ reducing inner conflict
    + reduces self-deception
    + makes you less ego-centrical
    + makes you more in touch with reality
        + the need for real/in touch/connected is a meta-drive
        + reducing inner conflict is a meta-drive

The positive feedback cycle of reducing inner conflict and getting more in touch with reality:

+ I get better knowledge of myself --> I can better teach the man
    + to be a good teacher, you have to know your student better
+ as I get better knowledge of myself
    + --> I can teach the man
    + --> I can better train the lion
    + --> I can better tame the monster

In other words:

+ I improve a little bit my skill of picking up on real patterns
+ I use that skill on myself to increase my self-knowledge
+ which reduces my inner conflict
+ as my inner conflict goes down, I get a clearer vision of reality
+ as I get a clearer vision of reality, I get better at picking up on real patterns
+ which means I improve myself knowledge
+ which means I reduce my inner-conflict...

--> upward spiral, ascent, **anagoge**: your inner conflict goes down, and you become more in touch with reality

+ you participate in this self-transformatory  process --> participatory knowing
    + I change myself
    + then the world changes/discloses more
    + which makes me change more

#### The Myth of the Cave

+ people chained facing the wall
    + seeing shadows, hearing echoes
    + they think that is reality
+ one individual gets free, sees the fire
    + realizes shadows, echoes aren't the real thing
    + this person starts to see real patterns
    + taste of reality, exploration
+ start to go climb up
    + getting blinded by the light
    + have to stop, adapt
    + take one step further...
    + participatory transformation
+ reach the surface, look around, wanting to see the source of light
     + the sun is overwhelming
     + but fills them with awe
+ go back down, wanting to tell the story
     + but they stumble
     + the fellow prisoners ridicule them
     + want to kill them (allusion to Socrates)

This is a myth of Enlightenment, liberation, self-transformation: anagoge (ascent).

+ movement from the illusory world to the real world
+ you can make your life rationally more meaningful
    + you become more at peace with yourself
    + and at the same time more in contact with the real patterns, that help to make sense of the world
    + in a mutually supportive fashion
+ this is wisdom, enhanced meaning in life
+ (The Matrix analogy)
+ reason and spirituality are bound

A perennial parable, that is a refrain in the West.

Influences

+ Socrates:
    + get the man to teach the lion
    + realize your foolishness
    + dialogue
+ Pythagoras:
    + flying above yourself
    + radical transformation of cognition and consciousness

#### Idos

+ gestalt
+ paradigm
+ real patterns
    + pathway to understand sth
    + what makes sth be what is is

Psychology of concepts:

+ not just a feature list (eg. bird: wings, feather, flight)
+ need a structural-functional organization
    + makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts
        + logos (gr)

Logos

+ picking up on real patterns implicitly, intuitively
    + what is the logos of a bird ?
    + don't know propositionally
+ intuitive grasp on the logos of things
    + how your mind can be integrated with the thing
    + different kind of knowing:
        + **conforming** to it,
        + becoming like it: in my mind there is the same real pattern
        + reciprocal realization with the thing
