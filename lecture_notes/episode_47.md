# Episode 47 - Heidegger

## Recap

+ __Husserl__: loss of *contact epistemology*
    + trying to get the contact back through experiential attention to our experience:
        1. mental directedness - *noesis*
        2. world disclosure - *noema*
    + correlation between *noesis* and *noema* is like the agent-arena relationship
+ __Heidegger's criticism__:
    + Husserl is not giving back the missing contact
    + Sparrow: The End of Phenomenology
    + missing participatory knowing
        + Merleau-Ponty's work on *embodiment* addresses this
            + return to contact epistemology
    + participatory knowing is not set within ontology / deeper understanding of *Being*
        + how to come in contact with realness / that which grounds truth
    + trapped within subjectivity/idealism (Cartesian heritage)

## Heidegger

+ independence of *Being* from our experience of it
+ how to get to the *deeper contact*
    + transcending phenomenology to drive towards *ontology*
+ questioning/*questing* within the *being mode* experienced as *wonder*
    + no propositional answer
    + rather bringing a participatory transformation
+ *dasein*: being there / our being
    + Christian heritage: being in the image of God
    + by questing/wandering into our being
        + getting a deeper understanding of Being itself
+ our being is the being whose being is in question
    + questioning *who and what we are* makes a difference to who and what we are
        + core idea of **existentialism**
            + we are without an *essence*: our essence is to have no essence
            + we are continually defining ourselves
        + coming into contact with the *being mode* and the mystery of being
+ main thread/argument:
    + the history of metaphysics, is the history of nihilism
        + metaphysics: philosophical/existential/religious responses to *dasein*
    + misconstrued project (misframing) of our relationship to *Being*
        + loss of contact with our being / Being itself
        + lead us into the meaning crisis
+ ontological project:
    + understanding our being, and thereby understanding our relation to being / Being itself

#### Style

+ difficult to read
    + *aporatic* structure: failing to come to clear conclusion
        1. wrestling to break out from the cognitive-cultural grammar
        2. self-promotional: creating a mystique around himself
+ have to read a lot of H before reading H well
+ difficult to point to the core of Heidegger

### Vom Wesen der Wahrheit

+ on the essence of truth

> A statement is invested with its correctness by the openness of comportment; for only through the latter can what is opened up really become the standard for the presentative correspondence.

+ `statement is invested with its correctness`: a statement is true
+ `openness of comportment`:
    + how you are comported towards things
+ standard notion of truth: *truth as correspondence*
    + what makes a *statement* true is that it *corresponds* with reality
        + what's in the statement, and what's in reality corresponds
    + philosophers have long debated about what *correspondence* exactly is
    + according to H the debate has missed that the *corresponding relationship* is grounded/depend on a deeper relationship

> Open comportment must let itself be assigned this standard.

+ *open comportment* is an affordance of the ability to set up correspondence between *statements* and *reality*, such that we find them true
+ by making a statement the person is *directed* and *connected*
    + also means that the statement is picking up on some aspect of reality

> This means that it must take over a pregiven standard for all presenting. This belongs to the openness of comportment.

+ the normative standard: what we normally call *truth*
    + truth as correctness: correspondence between statement and reality
+ truth is grounded in the agent-arena relationship
    + what the *agent* says/does is meaningful in the *arena*
    + what grounds the agent-arena relationship ?
        + Vervaeke: process of RR
        + Heidegger: *attunement*

> Being attuned can never be understood as "experience" and "feeling", because it is thereby simply deprived of its essence.

+ rejecting any *subjective* interpretation of attunement
    + losing the essence of attunement, if understanding it subjectively
+ attunement is *not* an experience
    + it is what *makes* meaningful experience possible
        + like RR

> Being attuned, i.e., ek-sistent exposedness to beings as a whole, can be "experienced" and "felt" only because the man who "experiences" without being aware of the essence of the attunement, is always engaged in being attuned in a way that discloses beings as a whole.

+ word-play: *ek-sistent*: standing out
+ any *subjective experience* is grounded in an *attuning relationship*
    + that precedes/grounds our cognitive appraisal/appropiation within the agent-arena relationship
+ we are locked up in the propositional: `truth is correspondence`
    + we have forgotten the *attunement relationship* that is the *essence* of truth
        + makes the correctness of statement possible for us

> man clings to what is readily available and controllable even where ultimate matters are concerned.

+ because of the __forgetfulness__, we are trapped into the **having** of correct propositions (having mode)
    + deep modal confusion at the existential level
+ Plato: *philia sophia* vs *philia nikia*
    + love of wisdom vs love of victory
        + love of victory is the deepest kind of bullshitting
            + pretense of arguing/reasoning by manipulating propositions, asserting correctness, **forgetting** the pursuit of wisdom
                + Socrates' existential project
            + some people cannot
                + come out of modal confusion
                + remember the being mode
                + listen
+ H sees the history of metaphysics more and more bound up with *philia nikia*
    + the ultimate theory that crushes all opposition
+ we have to wake up from the state of deep forgetfulness/modal confusion
    + H's texts are deliberately Socratic undermining our cognitive-cultural grammar
+ H wants us to remember *sati* the forgotten mystery of *dasein*

> Whenever the concealment of being as whole is conceded only as a limit, that occasionally  announces itself, concealing as a fundamental occurrence has sunk into forgetfulness.

+ if we only acknowledge *the way beings transcend our framing of them* at the limit, that means we have actually forgotten it
    + the relationship to the *combinatorially explosive* nature of things has to be an ongoing feature of your thinking
    + within the RR framework this is the idea of *sacredness*
        + enacted/participatory resonance to the moreness/inexhaustibleness of reality

## Harman

### Object-Oriented Ontology / Speculative Realism

+ critique of phenomenology as being inadequate
+ one important thread here (not a summary), explicating Heiddeger's idea of *attunement*:
+ Kant: *the thing in itself* veiled by subjectivity 
    + subjectivity completely veils the thing in itself and makes it inaccessible to us
+ Harman: the *transjective attunement* (from Heidegger) makes both the *subject* and *object* possible in phenomenological experience
    1. the thing is **shining into my subjectivity**
        + gr. *phenomenon*: shine forth
    2. and simultaneously **withdrawing/beyond from my framing**
        + the *beyondness* is contributing to the realness of my phenomenological experience
        + eg. in VR, if the world is close (you can drain it dry with your activity), it loses its realness 
            + the *comportment of openness*: when there is realness, the world withdraws beyond you continually:
                + the horizon of your experience: sth you always move towards, but never reach
+ if the world constantly *withraws* and *shines* into your experience, then it is real to you
+ our **transjective framing**/attunement simultaneously *discloses* and *conceals*
+ the `thing in itself` `-->` the `thing beyond itself`
    + `the thing beyond itself`: shining into our subjectivity and withdrawing beyond our framing of it
        + co-contributing to the realness of the object for us
        + *withdrawing* was missed by phenomenology
            + bound within a subjective Cartesian framework (?)
+ object: `the thing beyond itself`

## New Understanding of Truth (Heidegger)

+ attunement that discloses things as `things beyond themselves`
    + shining into our *subjectivity* & withdrawing into their *objectivity*
        + *objectivity*: a depth beyond our framing (not an object of thought), an independence beyond our experience
        + transjective interpenetration
+ truth as *alethea*
    + gr. *lethe*: to cover/forget, river of forgetfulness around the underworld
    + *a-lethea*: deep remembering/disclosure
        1. modally *remember* (*sati*)
        2. *disclosing* aspect of reality (shining & withdrawing)
    + *attuning* to the mutual disclosure/fittedness within the mystery of *Being*
        + you are deeply/existentially remembering things, when you are attuned how they simultaneously shining & withdrawing

## Heidegger - Dreyfus - 4E/3rd Generation CogSci

+ __Dreyfus__ is a founding figure of 3rd gen. cogsci 
    + articulating the importance of Heidegger for understanding the nature of mind/cognition*consciousness
    + book *Being in the World* (reference to H's *Being in Time*)
    + exemplary quote:

> Facts and rules are by themselves meaninglessness, to capture that Heidegger calls significance or involvement they must be **assigned relevance**. But the predicates that must be added to define relevance are just more meaningless facts. And paradoxically, the more facts the computer is given, the harder it is to compute what is relevant to the current situation.

+ you cannot capture *relevance* with a definition
+ if staying at the propositional*computational level, we get into comb explosion
    + and lose our ability to cope/fit ourselves to the current situation
+ deep critique of a purely computational/Cartesian approach to psychology/cogsci/AI
    + books: *What Computers (Still) Can't Do*
        + discovery of the *frame problem* within cogsci
        + sees Heidegger as the forerunner of understanding the mind **not** only computationally/propositionally
+ developing the notion of *optimal grip* (with Marleau-Ponty)
    + process doing RR
    + deeper than propositional knowing

### Deep Dialogue with the Central Prophets of the Meaning Crisis (MC)

+ converging arguments:
    + Dreyfus & Taylor: *Retrieving Realism*: how to make *contact* using RR/optimal gripping, etc.
+ **the framework**: RR, participatory knowing, optimal gripping
+ connecting Heidegger and other prophets to the framework
    + synoptic integration of them into a more comprehensive response to the MC
    + final part of Vervaeke's argument 

### R. Avens: The New Gnosis

+ linking Heidegger to Corbin/Jung

> A questioning the involves the questioner in the matter of thought so deeply, he becomes in a sense one with it. At this point knowing is no longer divorced from being. We know the way we are, and we are the way we know. In the Platonic tradition this is expressed as the axiom: like can only be known by like.

+ participatory knowing as a deep kind of *con-formity* between you and the world
    + Neoplatonic idea, (not Aristotelian ?)
    + dynamic coupling

#### Heidegger and Corbin

+ Corbin is the first French translator of H
+ Corbin calls the participatory knowing / dynamical coupling *gnosis* 
    + Corbin quote on *gnosis*

> A salvational, redemptive knowledge, because it has the virtue of bringing about the inner transformation of man. It is knowing that "changes and transforms" the knowing subject.

+ dynamic coupling: you know sth insofar as you are changed
+ your knowing of yourself and your knowing of the object/world are coupled together
    + responding to *dasein*
        + you are the being whose being is in question
        + by questing into that, you quest into Being

### H's Influence on Dreyfus and Corbin

+ __Dreyfus__: **RR**
    + non-propositional/computational
+ __Corbin__: **gnosis**
    + participatory, mutually self- and world-transformative knowing
    + redemptive, saves us from existential entrapment
        + way of responding to the modal confusion / forgetfulness of Being / MC

#### Modal Confusion of Ontotheology

+ *being mode*
    + transformative participation in the mystery of being
    + leading to *alethea*
        1. *attunement* (relevance)
        2. *independence of Being*
            + moreness: Being always transcends how it is being known/experienced by us
            + not truth, but *relevance*; but: *relevance* should not be disconnected from *truth*
            + relevance must be open to (as an ongoing constraint, not a limit) the *moreness/inexhaustibleness* of the `thing beyond itself`
+ *having mode*
    + thinking of an object as how it can be manipulated by us physically/conceptually
    + solving problems
    + dangers: (mis)understand `Being as a being`
        + when trying to get back to the *being mode* or sth is wrong, we put it into the *limit*
            + understanding *Being* as a *supreme/highest being*
                + turning *Being* that can be solved by conceptual manipulation
                + for H this is the ultimate modal confusion: *theism*
+ **problem of ontotheology**:
    + according to H there is a long-standing tradition (*metaphysics*) where God is understood within the *having mode* as a *supreme being*
        + that grounds/makes all other beings
    + connection between understanding *Being* as a *supreme being* and **nihilism** 
        + causes us existentially adrift in modal confusion
        + causes us to misframe our relationship with Being
        + causes us *disconnect* from realness: which is at the heart of the MC
    + influence of Nietzsche

## Heidegger and Tillich

+ Tillich was the first non-Jewish academic to be persecuted for opposing the Nazis
+ Heidegger joined the Nazi party
    + since H's position is existential (not just theoretical), this cannot be dismissed
+ Tillich picks up H's critique of ontotheology, and show what is wrong with *idolatry*

## Next up

+ Corbin and **gnosis**:
    + what would it be like to remember through alethea
    + experiencing the remembering as awakening from the MC

## Appendix

#### On the Essence of Truth (1943): 2. The Inner Possibility of Accordance

> 18.  Comportment stands open to beings. Every open relatedness is a comportment. Man’s open stance varies depending on the kind of beings and the way of comportment. All working and achieving, all action and calculation, keep within an open region within which beings, with regard to what they are and how they are, can properly take their stand and become capable of being said. This can occur only if beings present themselves along with the presentative statement so that the latter subordinates itself to the directive that it speak of beings such as they are. In following such a directive the statement conforms to beings. Speech that directs itself accordingly is correct (true). What is thus said is the correct (the true). A statement is invested with its correctness by the openness of comportment; for only through the latter can what is opened up really become the standard for the presentative correspondence. Open comportment must let itself be assigned this standard. This means that it must take over a pregiven standard for all presenting. This belongs to the openness of comportment. But if the correctness (truth) of statements becomes possible only through this openness of comportment, then what first makes correctness possible must with more original right be taken as the essence of truth. 

#### On the Essence of Truth (1943): 5. The Essence of Truth

> 35.  The essence of truth reveals itself as freedom. The latter is ek-sistent, disclosive letting beings be. Every mode of open comportment flourishes in letting beings be and in each case is a comportment to this or that being. As engagement in the disclosure of being as a whole as such, freedom has already attuned all comportment to being as a whole. However, being attuned (attunement) can never be understood as "experience and "feeling," because it is thereby simply deprived of its essence. For here it is interpreted on the basis of something ("life" and "soul") that can maintain the semblance of the title of essence only as long as it bears in itself the distortion and misinterpretation of being attuned. Being attuned, i.e., ek-sistent exposedness to beings as a whole, can be "experienced" and "felt" only because the "man who "experiences" without being aware of the essence of the attunement, is always engaged in being attuned in a way that discloses beings as a whole.
