# Episode 35 - The Symbol, Sacredness and the Sacred

## Recap

### Sacredness

Two opponent aspects:

#### Geertz:

+ sacredness is homing us against domicide/horror

#### Otto:

+ sacredness puts us in contact with the numinous
    + exposing us to our limits, humility

#### Symbol

Worldview attunement:

+ wonder: meta-assimilation, compression, integration
+ awe/numinous/horror: meta-accomodation
+ sacredness is playing with the machinery of RR:
    + primordial aspects of religio
+ serious play by engaging in symbolic behavior
    + eg. music
    + symbol exemplifies, participatory aspect
    + symbol bridging between:
        + meta-assimilation:
        + meta-assimilation:

#### Metaphor

+ at the core of a symbol there is a metaphor
    + profound
    + pervasive in our cognition
    + functional, bidirectional process:
        + bottom up projection from physical domain &
        + top down: conceptual to physical (selection constraints)
        + exaptation process
+ exaptation of cerebellum:
    + physical balance
    + use that to find contingency relationships between any areas of the brain
+ holding in mind: reverse exaptation: __activation__
    + activate the symbol for a purpose
    + go down from conceptual/symbol to physical
    + symbol of scale --> balance --> cerebellum
    + practice the skill of being just: find contingencies between
multiple variables
    + the symbol is affording me to become more just
+ symbols are functional and active in us

## Symbol

1. the *symbol* is transforming *me*
2. *I* start to see through the *symbol* at *justice*
3. *I* understand *it* more, start interacting with *it*, cultivating
the skills of *justice*
     + perspectival awareness
     + *it* discloses *itself* to *me* more

### Symbol Processing Machinery

#### Breath as a Symbol

Meditation:

1. focusing on the breath
2 scaling down
3. becoming sensitized by scaling down to the processing of my mind
    + mind is not a container but a process
    + pain is not a thing/noun, but also a process/verb
    + (balance is not a thing/noun, but also a process/verb)
    + pain is not sth I possess, it is sth I participate in
4. breath starts to become a participatory symbol of the impermanence of things
    + flowing and interconnectedness
5. 4) impacts the sense of myself:
    + the self is more impermanent, interconnected
6. *I* look through the *breath* at impermanence*
7. *impermanence* form the sense of *myself*
8. after training, scaling up might happen:
    + all of reality is impermanent and interconnected

#### Play and Symbol Processing (Polanyi)

Normal processing:

+ subsidiary awarenesses are integrated together into focal awareness
    + eg. getting the bottle
    + being interested in the focal object

Symbol processing:

+ contemplating the symbol
    + being intesrested in the process
    + integrating together associations, emotions in myself
    + becoming more just, participating in justice
+ eg. looking at the breath (focal awareness)
    + being interested in the process, not an insight about the breath
    + integrating all my processing together --> my processing becomes
more powerful
    + the breath sudddenly discloses new reality to me --> getting an insight
        + impermanence, interconnectedness
    + opens me up, I'm becoming somebody else
    + refocusing on the breath again
    + re-integrating the new reality and new me into that
    + the breath sudddenly discloses new, deeper reality to me -->
getting an insight
    + opens me up, I'm becoming somebody else
    + refocusing on the breath again
    + resonating between intergrating, re-focusing, re-integrating:
+ symbols are capable affording **anagoge**:
    + getting inner optimization -->
    + seeing more deeply into the thing -->
    + that transforms me to fot the new world -->
    + getting more inner optimization
+ symbols are capable affording senssibility transcendence
    + bidirectional insight:
        + seeing sth differently, and seeing your seeing differently
    + transframing
+ playing the serious play with the symbol

####  Symbols Summary

+ symbols activate you, and draw you beyond yourself
    + __ex-static__: standing outside yourself
    + moving from smaller frame to bigger
+ symbols are __participatory__
+ symbols are __integrative__
    + in an anagogic fashion
    + integrating you together -->
    + integating a new world together -->
    + integrating the integrated you into the integrated new world
+ symbols are __complex__, multi-faceted
    + eg. Athena: symbol of wisdom and warfare
    + different areas are brought together: re-configuring the
salience landscape
+ opponent processes in the symbol:
    + opening up the world to meta-accomodation
    + drawing in yourself to the new world: meta-assimilation
+ symbols are inherently transjective:
    + moving between two worlds
+ symbols are transgressive
+ symbols trigger transframing
+ symbols are transformative

### Symbols and Sacredness/Mystery

+ wonder/awe
+ horror/awe

#### Mythos

+ (patterns of representation)
+ patterns of interaction: connected to ritual
    + __ritual__: enactive engaging/anagoge
        + processes by which transformation is activated
    + __symbols__:
        + enmeshed with __story__, narrative
    + story connects with ritual:
        + enacting the story
+ with __mythos__ we can activate __religio__:
    + seriously play with -->
    + enhance its capacities for meta-assimilation/accommodation
    + --> __sacredness__
+ our relationship to religio can only be born symbolically
    + <-- primordial/participatory nature of religio
+ religio is deeply valuable to us
+ at the core of religio is RR
+ RR is intrinsically interested in itself
    + evolutionary adapitve
    + self-transcending/correcting/organizing process
    + (in insight we are correcting for a misleading salience pattern, problem formulation)
+ `RR --> religio` is the machinery of meaning making, and we use
mythos to celebrate it
    + as RR is interested in itself

#### The Sacred

+ __experience__ of *sacredness*
    + using the machinery of religio/mythos:
        + serious play is developmentally important to us
        + as RR is intrinsically interested in itself
    + opens up the world to people
    + opens up the self
    + transformative
    + feels like making love with reality
+ __essence__ of *sacredness*:
    + *the sacred*
    + metaphysical proposal:
        + an **absolute value** that generates *sacrednesss*
        + this absolute vallue have a metaphysical status:
            + it is above nature: super-natural
    + there are things that are always of relevance to us:
        + --> there is an essence to relevance
            + there is a final formula for being relevant
            + that esssence inheres in a particular object/place which
is therefore sacred
+ JV refutes the metaphysical proposal / essence of sacredness
    + __there is no essence to relevance__
    + there is no essence to sacredness
    + relevance is not a thing, but a process of RR
    + the only thing RR is intrinsically interested in is itself
        + except for depression/suicide
    + the notion of sacred is a category mistake:
        + product of RR != process of RR
        + general mistake: getting fixated on the product of
cognition, and not paying attention to the process
+ Gnostics:
    + relationship to sacredness is evolving, transgressive:
        + constant transframing
    + constantly inventing new mythos, rituals
+ alternative (metaphysical?) proposal of *sacredness*
    + without needing the supernatural as a category

#### Alternative Sacred(ness) Proposal

+ inexhaustible process of reality disclosing itself to us
    + <-- reality is combinatorically explosive
+ the RR process is also inexhausible:
    + a constantly evolving process
    + constituted by its evolution
+ sacredness is an experience of the inexhaustibleness of reality and RR
    + not an essence / stabilized final form
+ eg. Plato is sacred for JV:
    + no absolute/supernatural value, no completeness, no final form
of relevance
    + process of anagoge:
        + readig P, understanding P -->
        + impacts/tranforms (the cognitive processes of) the self
        + going out in the world, the world discloses in a new way
        + returning to P, see/understand him in a new way -->
        + the new realizations reach deeply into me
        + going out in the world ...
    + gnosis: inexhausible source of transframing, co-identification
        + developmental wonder
    + "I see through the text, and then the world reaches through it to me."
+ eg. Nietzche: "If you stare long enough into the abyss, it begins to
stare back *through* you."
+ *the sacred* is the transjective relationship with the combinatorically explosive nature of reality
    + reality cannot be framed, it will always transcend your framing
        + the *framing* that can never be captured in the *frame*
    + *no-thingness*
    + linked to the *no-thingness* of the self:
        + the *I* can never be captured in the *me*
    + deep symbolic resonance between the two *no-thingnesses*
        + inexhaustibleness of reality & inexhaustibleness of RR
            + coupled at the primordial levels of religio
    + ongoing, never completing nature of RR

> The inexhaustible that powers the experience of sacredness in a deeply participatory fashion.
