## Socrates

+ major influence on Plato
+ part of the cognitive and existential grammar of the West
+ provocation

### Biography

+ Oracle of Delphi, Phytia
    + "Is there anyone wiser than Socrates ?"
    + "No."
+  Response of Socrates:
    + no confirmation bias, no acceptance
    1. "Gods can't lie."
         + gods represent moral exemplars for ways we can morally improve, and self-transcendence
         + truth and sacredness are bound (reality and divinity)
    2. "I'm not wise."
        + Personal slogan: Nosce te ipsum / know thyself.
            + not in an autobiographical sense
            + self-knowledge, understanding how you operate
                + powers, perils and constraints operating within you
                + participatory knowing
            + responsibility for your own cognition
+ 1. and 2. are contradicting, but he holds both
    + 1) is a disclosure from reality
    + 2) is existential self-knowledge
    + neither is greater
    + personal dilemma:
         + how can it be, that he is the wisest human being when he knows that he is not wise
+ starts on a quest on how 1) and 2) can both be the case at the same time
+ the quest evolved to a method he interacted with people
    + the Socratic method

### Socratic method
  
+ asking questions to dry somebody out
+ 2 types/groups of people he interacts with

#### Natural philosophers

Thales:

+ none true, but kind of thinking is scientific
    + not mythology, story, narrative, no divine agents
    + rational analysis
    + "inventing" how to think scientifically

1. All is the moist.
    + the underlying substance of things is water
    + reason & observation for a plausible explanatopn
2. Loadstone is psyche.
    + loadstone == magnet
    + magnets move themselves and others
    + psyche original meaning: self-moving and making other things move
         + mind is the most self-moving part of you
    + everything that's living is self-moving
    + reasoning: false conclusion, but rational argument
        1. I have psyche, and I can move and move other things.
        2. magnets can move and move other things
        3. magnet also has psyche
    + looking for the underlying force behind things
3. Everything is filled with gods.
    + not a throwback to mythology
    + ontology: study of being, structure of things
    + ontological analysis: get at the underlying structure/forces of reality
    + Thales is doing ontological analysis
        + access to the depths of reality: provokes awe, wonder
        + connect to what's most real
        + make most sense of things
        + --> experience it as sacred

Anaxagoras

+ sun is not a god, but a hot rock

#### Socrates' rejection of natural philosophers

+ Socrates rejects natural philosophers' search for truth
    + truth, facts without self-transformation
    + **truth without (existential) relevance**
        + these truths don't enable the self-transcendence
    + they don't help with
        + finding wisdom, self-transcendence
        + overcome self-deception
        + becoming a better person
    + relationship: disappointment
    + analogy with the critic of modern science

#### Sophists

+ direct democracy in Athens
+ ability for debating/arguing/persuading is the route to power
+ the psychotech of rhetoric is invented
    + standardized skills to influence people
    + sophists teach it
    + no moral commitment
+ when we are communicating we are being driven by what we find relevant and salient, not truth or what we believe
    + modern example: advertising
    + disconnection from truth

#### Bullshit

+ Henry Frankfurt
+ bullshit != lying
     + lying: change so's behavior based on their commitment to truth
+ bullshit:
    + making you uninterested in the truth value of a statement/claim
    + capture you with sth catchy, salient
    + separation of relevance/salience from truth
+ you cannot lie to yourself (cannot change belief), but you can bullshit yourself
+ self-deception: self-bullshitting
    1. directing attention
    2. attention can be captured by sth salient
    + --> 1) and 2) feed on each other


####  Socrates' antagonistic relationship to the Sophists

+ sophists are the reverse of the axial revolution
+ sophist are the opposite of rational self-knowledge, and the attempt to overcome self-deception
+ sophists advertise self-deception
+ **relevance without/disconnected from truth**

Group | Method | Socrates' critic
--- | --- | ---
Natural philosophers | ontological analysis | truth without relevance
Sophists | rhetoric | relevance without truth

#### Socratic notion of wisdom

+ self-knowledge bound with meaning in life
+ know how to pay attention, and use what you find salient to determine the truth
    + make found truth train your attention to find salience
    + positive feedback loop
+ wisdom is to keep your truth and relevance machinery coupled together

#### Socratic method II

```
S: why are you here in the market ?
P: Purchasing some goods.
S: Why do you want these goods ?
P: Because they'll make me happy.
S: What is happiness ?
P: Happiness is pleasure.
S: Can pleasure and a horrible situation co-exist ?
P: Of course.
S: Then happiness is not pleasure. What is happiness then ?
P: Getting what is most important to you.
S: How do you know what is most important ?
P: Through knowledge.
S: What kind of knowledge ?
P: Wisdom.
S: Tell me how you cultivated wisdom.
P: ...
```

+ questioning until the person falls into aporia
    + state of confusion
+ S wants to show how much we are deceiving/bullshitting ourselves
    + we pursue salient things: fame, money, happiness
    + but we don't understand them
+ reaction of people:
    + people get angry --> pisses them off --> trial
    + people get insight and start pursuing wisdom; find a way how relevance and truth can enable each other
+ S finds a solution to his dilemma through observing the effect of his method on people
    + he knew what he did not know: I'm pursuing sth and I don't know why.

#### Trial

+ accused of atheism
+ but would let him go, if he stopped doing philosophy
+ S's response:

> The unexamined life is not worth living.

+ Ta Erotica
    + eros: love of uniting
    + S knows how to love well, what to care about
    + S knows how to keep what you care about with what is real
+ S compared himself to a midwife
    + helping people draw out / give birth to a better self
+ S knew how reason & love go together
    + we should know rationally what we should most care about


+ losing, appealing, losing again, condemned to death
    + willing to die for meaning
+ shamanic traces
+ next up: Plato (Pythagoras & Socrates)
