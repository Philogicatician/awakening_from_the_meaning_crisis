## Questions

1. if RR is at the core of intelligence, and RR can be improved, then intelligence can be improved as well ?
2. what is *openness of comportment* ? (Heidegger)
3. more on the *cognitive-cultural grammar* (Wittgenstein)
4. Heidegger:
    + `Sein` is a German noun, always capitalized
    + withdrawing == becoming transparent in the process (eg. hammer)
5. immediate/sudden vs developmental/gradual transformation/realization
    + aspirational aspect of rationality: proleptic rationality
        + incremental/developmental changes
    + but: some Buddhists say that *wanting* realization is inherently impure, because
        + you want to reach a goal out of fear (impure motivations)
            + plus reaching a goal is still in the *having mode*
        + no matter how many levels you achieve in your practice,
            + you are not realizing what was already there right from the beginning
6. what's the difference between alethea/sati/remembering the being mode and the Romantic expressing the true authentic self that has always been there ?
7. axial revolution: the emergence of self-reflection/correction
    + are the ability for self-correction and self deception the two sides of the same coin ?
        + running on the same machinery ?
    + the Bible: is self-awareness the original sin ?
         + missing the mark with greater self-awareness ?
    + the Buddha: is this greater self-awareness that causes dukkha ?
        + walking on a razor's blade between greater self awareness and greater self-deception ?
    + is the axial age where the "modern" sense of self arises ?

## TODO's
