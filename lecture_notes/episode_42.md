# Episode 42 - Intelligence, Rationality, and Wisdom

## Recap

+ looking at *rationality*
    + because we are building towards an account of *wisdom*
        + because wisdom is intertwined with the cultivation of:
            + *enlightenment*
            + *meaning*
+ rationality is an existential issue
    + constitutive of our identity/mode of being in the world
+ the rationality debate
    + `logicality != rationality`, `intelligence != rationality`
    + we need multiple competencies in rationality
        + *inferential* competency
        + competency of *construal*
            + normative theory on construal: insight, good problem formulation
        + missing pieces (overlapping):
            + mindware
            + cognitive style of *active open-mindedness* (AOM) (J. Baron)
                + cultivate a sensitivity of the presence/effect of cognitive
                    biases in your cognition
                + actively counteracting them (in moderation/optimal amount)
                    + keeping the *heuristic* part of *bias*

## Definition of Psychotechnology

+ socially generated/standardized way of formatting/manipulating/enhancing
    information processing
+ it is readily internalizable into human cognition
+ it can be applied in a domain-general manner
+ it must extend/empower cognition in a reliable manner
+ it must be highly generalizable among people
+ prototypical instances: literacy, numeracy, graphic

## Active Open-Mindedness (AOM)

+ *active open-mindedness* (AOM) makes use of psychotechnology to track bias
+ what is it in people predicting acquiring AOM
    + *need for cognition*: motivation for finding/formulating/solving problems
        + generating your learning/problem-solving
        + two ways: *curiosity* and *wonder*

### Need for Cognition

+ high need for cognition: problem finding

#### Problem Finding (Arlin, 1990)

+ finding problems/connections where others don't
    + central to wisdom (and creativity)

#### Problem Finders

+ features of a good *problem finder*
+ not simply adding to the existing space of problems
    + but find problems that help solving existing problems
        + generate a *problem nexus*
+ Dreyfus: many of the problems of cognition are centered around the ability to
    *realize relevance*
+ *problem nexus* is generative of theoretical/empirical research
+ the *effectiveness* of *problem nexus* will help explaining *understanding*
    + will expand on it later

### Affective/Motivational Aspect

> Wisdom begins in wonder. (Socrates)

wonder | curiosity
--- | ---
being mode | having mode
mystery, questioning one's identity/worldview | controlling, manipulating
__Plato__ | __Aristotle__
deepen wonder into awe | formulate problems/questions
awe can transform us | resolve/solve problems
quest of anagoge |
meta-accommodation | meta-assimilation

+ higher order RR working within the *need for cognition*

## Theory of Rationality by Stanovich

### Responding to Defenders of Human Rationality (Negative Account)

#### Cohen

+ no single/static/individual competence competence

#### Cherniak

+ computational limitations are about *intelligence* not rationality

#### Smedslund

+ independent normativity on *construal*
    + psychology of good problem formulation and insight, to avoid:
    + comb explosion
    + ill-defined problems
    + misdirection by salience

### Positive Account of Rationality

+ we have multiple competencies

#### Dual-Processing

+ controversial concept:
    + two systems/styles - lot of criticism
    + maybe just two poles on the same continuum
+ different ways of processing info
    + one is more foregrounded
+ Kahneman

mode | S1 | S2
--- | --- | ---
 | intuitive | deliberate
 | associative (heuristics/biases) | inferential/argumentative
processing | implicit | explicit
processing speed | fast | slow
 | background cognition | 
working memory usage | automatic | using a lot of working memory
problem solving | construal | reasoning/inference
cogntive style | mindfulness | AOM
good for | therapy | theory
good for | coping/caring | planning

+ S1 and S2 are in trade-off/opponent relationship
    + their goal is making you adaptive
    + S2 overrides/corrects S1
    + but: cannot rely on S2 too much - working memory (WM) limitations

#### Foolishness/Disrationalia

+ S1 makes you *leap to conclusions* (fast coping)
    + S2 has to override biases sometimes
+ *AOM* (S2) protects you from *leaping* (S1)
+ you are *foolish* if you have not trained S2 from the interference of S1
+ but you need both competencies (S1 and S2)

## Vervaeke's Criticism of the Stanovich Theory

### Pro/Praise

+ not equating *intelligence* or *logicality* with *rationality*
+ overcoming self-deception
    + like Plato: *monster* interfering with the *man*

### Contra/Critique

+ cultivating AOM makes us more comprehensively rational
    + but: AOM is an insufficient account of rationality
 
 __Baker, Senate (1996)__

+ ~~inductive~~/*cognitive leaping*
    + recognizing an unfolding pattern (feature to gestalt, opacity-transparency shift)
+ operationalizing the leap in *insight*
    + good *leaper*: fewer cues and accurate guess
    + graph where *x-axis* is `nr of cues`, *y-axis* is `accuracy`:

accuracy | few cues | many cues
--- | --- | ---
high | good leaper | bad leaper
low | bad leaper | bad leaper

+ pattern detection/completion skill (*leaping*)
    + predictive of *insight*
+ shutting off leaping to conclusions (S1) also shuts off the machinery of insight
    + rationality needs leaping, insight
    + S1 and S2 are in trade-off: optimization is needed

__Error of Interference__:

+ leaping to conclusions (S1) can cause error in the inference
    + need AOM (S2) to moderate that
    + danger to theorizing (in academic context)
        + but rationality is *existential*
+ leaping to insight is needed for good *construal*
+ AOM is needed to correct leaping
    + **AOM** is crucial in scientific **theorizing**
+ there are domains in which *transformative insight / radical re-construal* is crucial
    + **insight** is crucial in **therapy** (Jacobs)
        + qualitative development, self-transformation
    + also a called as **metacognitive insight** (Tiesdale)
        + you cannot infer your way out of existential entrapment
        + shut S2 down, prevent from __interfering__, *backgrounding* it
        + *foreground* S1
    + *mindfulness* is a good *cognitive style* to metacognitive insight
        + need an ecology of psychotechs to cultivate the cognitive style of mindfulness
            + eg. in meditation you try to shut down/constrain S2 (inner speech, inferential processing)
+ the __cognitive style mindfulness__ is opponent to __the cognitive style AOM__
    + `opponent != adversarial`
    + both train attention, and how you pay attention
+ S1 great for *coping*, S2 is great for epistemic *planning* for truth

__Missing from the Stanovich Account of Rationality__:

+ how to coordinate/optimize the two competencies: AOM and mindfulness
    + especially important to wisdom

## Extending the Stanovich Account

#### Stanovich

+ using *intelligence* recursively:
    + eg. when learning a new psychotech
    + using intelligence to improve intelligence/competences
        + optimizing competences:
            + enhancing the capacity for RR
    + that is *rationality*

#### Vervaeke

+ using *rationality* recursively:
    + that is *wisdom*
+ the way wisdom relates to rationality and intelligence
    + `recursive intelligence --> recursive rationality --> wisdom`

> Rationality is a reliable/systematic ability to overcome self-deception and to afford enhancement of development and meaning in life.

### Rationality Is Existential

### C. Dweck: Mindset

+ __mindset__: embodied view of intelligence
    1. fixed trait (eg. height)
    2. malleable trait (eg. weight)
+ attitude towards __error__ depends on the mindset
    + G as fixed trait: 
        + error reveals that you are not smart
        + focus in the *product*
    + G as malleable trait: 
        + error reveals that you have skills/efforts to improve
        + focus in the *process*
+ feedback can put you into one of these mindsets/modes/orientations
    + "you are smart": fixed trait mode - product salience
    + "you are using good skill": malleable trait mode - process salience
    + importance in parenting/schooling
+ __experiment__: using different feedback/praising styles with school-children
    + `group A`: praised for product
        + does not want to try harder problems
        + does not enjoy harder problems
        + solves 2nd set of problems worse
        + 40% lies about performance
    + `group B`: praised for process
        + wants to try harder problems (*need for cognition*)
        + enjoys harder problems
        + solves 2nd set of problems better 
        + self-reports/evaluates correctly on performance
    + `group C`: neutral acknowledgement
        + neutral towards harder problems
        + solves 2nd set of problems the same
        + self-reports/evaluates correctly on performance
+ conclusion:
    + framing/identification with processing has a huge impact on 
        + the problem solving ability
        + proclivity of self-deception
        + need for cognition
    + rationality is an *existential* thing (not just information processing)

### Is Intelligence Fixed or Malleable ?

+ long-term mindfulness practice can improve intelligence
    + by enhancing attention and working memory
+ but: by-and-large __intelligence is fixed__
+ but: __intelligence is malleable__ 
    + the way intelligence is recursively relates to itself
        + because __rationality is malleable__

#### Improving Rationality

+ rationality is existential:
    + you identify with your cognitive processing
        + this can *impede* or *enhance* the use of intelligence
        + possibility of cultivating the *right* kind of
            + recursion and identity (mindset on error)
            + cognitive styles (AOM & mindfulness)
        + that is the path of becoming more rational
            + and wise
