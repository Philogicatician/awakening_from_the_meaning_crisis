# Episode 06 - Aristotle, Kant and Evolution

## Recap

+ Plato' notion of wisdom: anagogic process
    + aligning parts of psyche
    + leads to achieving the meta-drive of inner peace
    + connection between knowing ourselves and knowing the world
         + allows to achieve the other meta-drive of being touch with reality

## Aristotle

+ scientific foundation of wisdom and meaning & worldview attunement
+ disciple of Plato
    + breaks away after 20 years: "While I love Plato, I love the truth more."
    + Plato did not explain change very well
+ biological influence

### How things grow, change - Aristotle I

+ idos: structural-functional organization (logos, gestalt)
    1. what makes a bird a bird
    2. a pattern by we know what a bird is
+ more dynamical approach of idos: development

#### Analogy with artefacts

+ block of wood --> make it to a chair, table
+ **actuality**: what makes the wood act like a chair vs a table
+ making a chair is an important change
    + form/idos: structural-functional organization
+ the wood is **potential**
    + wood has a potential chair, table
    + once made starts acting like a chair, table
+ **in-formation**: put a form into sth, actualizing its potential
    + give it a structural-functional organization, so it starts acting like chair, table

Analogy with the development of living things:

+ living things doing change on themselves
+ a living thing is like a chair making itself
    + eg. food --> you in-form it --> it becomes you

#### How you connect to the world/reality

### How things grow, change - scientific revolution

+ change occurs be-cause of a causal impact (Newton)
    + `A --> B --> C` (events are in causal order)

#### Kant

Why did the Newtonian model take over so quickly after the Aristotelian model ?

+ ` A --> B --> C` prevents circular/empty explanations
+ circular explanation: the homuncular fallacy
    + using vision explaining vision
+ problem:
    + living things that can grow do not follow the Newtonian model, eg. tree:
        + Q: what's making the tree ?
        + A: the sunlight.
        + Q: how does the sunlight get in ?
        + A: through the leaves.
        + Q: who makes the leaves ?
        + A: the tree.
        + Q: what makes the tree ?......
+ living things are **self-organizing**, making use of feedback cycles
   + the output of the system feeds back into the system
        + eg. the tree makes the leaves, that gathers energy, that goes into the processes that makes the leaves
+ how to give a non-circular explanation of feedback cycles ?
+ conclusion: no science for living things, biology is impossible

#### Dynamical Systems Theory (Alicia Juarrero)

1. where is the mistake in Kant's argument ?
2. we need to understand this, because we need to understand that we are living things that grow and develop, and growing and development are integral to our meaning and our sense of who and what we are

Idea from Aristotle in the explanation: dynamical systems theory: 
1. causes == events
    + make things happen
    + **actuality**
2. constraints == conditions
    + make things possible
    + **potentiality**
    + formal cause, structural-functional organization (Aristotle)
    + eg. conditions are structural-functional organized so that they make motion possible
    a. enabling constraints - make an event more possible
    b. selective constraints - reduce the possibility of events

Tree: 
+ biochemical events happening --> cause an idos/structural-functional organization
+ structure of the tree shapes the possibility of the events (leaves grow sideways to get more photons in)
    + structure constrains the events

`F = ma` (force = mass * acceleration)  
+ not an event, but potentiality

**Evolution** - one of the most significant theories of development and change 
+ natural selection: 1st dynamical systems theory
+ feedback cycle: sexual reproduction (like an accordion)
    + selective constraints: scarcity of resources <-- competition
        + reduction of options
    + enabling constraints: variation
        + increases options
+ increased variation opens up, pushed back down by the scarcity
    + --> constantly changing to be better fitted to the environment
    + circle (volvere)
+ influenced by Aristotelian ideas of actuality and potentiality

+ **virtual engine**: systematically regulating a feedback cycle:
    + selective constraint: **virtual governor** (limits what you can do in a system)
    + enabling constraint: **virtual generator** (generating options for a self-organizing system)

### How things grow, change - Aristotle II

+ interested in our development
    + Socrates: wisdom is to overcoming self-deception
    + Plato: adding structure to the theory of the psyche to explain overcoming self-deception
    + Aristotle: missing: how wisdom develops, grows

#### How wisdom develops

+ character (=! personality)
    + you can cultivate it explicitly
    + (virtue: hatóerő, erény) --> virtual engine
    + set of constraints that have been systematically cultivated in somebody
+ what is the virtual engine in the person's development
     + system of constraints identified with / internalized
+ how much time did you spend today on your character (vs appearance and status) ?
+ how to cultivate your character
    + golden mean
    + what is courage: golden rule mean between
        + coward: lacking enabling constraints
        + foolhardy (vakmerő): lacking selective constraints
    + train yourself, engage in practices that create a virtual engine to cultivate your character optimizing between selective and enabling constraints
        + you produce your actions that modify the env
        + the env feeds back into you
        + you produce updated actions...

> Are you trying to rationally and reflectively cultivate your character, structure a virtual engine, so that that self-organizing process is growing and developing in an optimal fashion ?

> Part of what makes your life meaningful is that you have cultivated character that allows you to actualize your potential.

+ self-organization has been regulated and shaped into self improvement

A. adds the growth aspect to wisdom: 
+ create your virtual engine: set of virtues that regulate growth
+ so that you actualize your potential

Akrasia:  
+ deep form of foolishness that comes from a lack of character
+ (bad translation: lack of will (<-- Protestant))
+ you know what's right to do, but you don't do it
    + you have the right believes, but you don't have sufficient character  (not trained skills and sensibilities)
+ != ignorance: you don't know what is the right thing

#### What is it to living up to your potential

+ developmental aspect to meaning
+ analogy with artefacts:
    + how do we know sth is well made ?
        + has a structural-functional organization that allows it to fulfill its purpose
+ humans are self making: autopoietic
    + difference with tornado: self-organizing, but can be rapidly self-destructive
    + promote your self-organization, seek out conditions
        + your purpose: enhance your structural-functional organization
            + you are a rational, reflective creature

system | in-forming
--- | ---
inorganic matter | NA
animal | self-moving
mental thing | actualize self-moving (psyche: mind: capacity for self-moving)
rational thing | actualize your potential

Rational thing is highest in the hierarchy: 
+ you must cultivate your character to
    + actualize your to potential for being a rational, moral human being
    + become a good person
        + if you in-form your being with a virtual engine that realizes those things that are distinctive of our humanity
+ what makes humans different from mental things, and lower; why do we matter more
    + your capacity for overcoming self-deception
    + your capacity for cultivating your character
    + your capacity for realizing wisdom
    + your capacity for enhancing the structure of your psyche and your contact with reality:
        + being a rational being
+ your purpose is to become as fully human as possible

> How much are you cultivating your character ?

+ how much of your life is dedicated to create a virtual engine that realizes your rational capacities, those that make you most human in contrast to other things around you ?

+ bringing back the depth to the terms: purpose, growth, potential, etc.
