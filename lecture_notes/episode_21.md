# Episode 21 - Martin Luther and Descartes

## Recap

+ our perception is illusory
+ Galileo: math as the new experimental method
    + discovering inertial in motion
    + matter resists our will
        + matter is dead
+ Aristotelian conformity (`structure of reality == structure of experience`) is gone
    + we are odd islands of purpose in a vast ocean of meaningless/purposeless motion
    + we are trapped in our minds
        + behind veils of illusion
        + disconnected from the world
+ God is a matter of will

## Luther (1483-1546)

+ Augustinian monk
    + our inability to achieve mystical union with God unaided
+ spirituality is about **inner conflict**
    + from Augustine, Paul
    + parallel to **God's love** towards us there is **God's justice/wrath**
        + being terrified by the wrath
    + *self-negation* becomes radicalized *self-loathing*
    + self is immorally self-centered, obsessed with itself
        + therefore cut off from God/reality
        + self+destructive process
+ __pride__:
    + self's essence is self-destruction
        + repeating self-destructive unconscious patterns
            + eg. dating the same kind of people
        + Luther is right about our unconscious cognition being beset by *parasitic processing*
+ we cannot do anything to save ourselves
    + we are saved by faith alone
+ __faith__: **radical acceptance** of God's will/saving grace
    + *participatory knowing* (participation in God's creation) is gone
    + *perspectival knowing*: sense of self is illusory
    + acceptance of propositions
        + not based on evidence, but given to you
        + you don't participate in your salvation:
            + self-negation of the Rheinland mystics coming to fruition
+ God's saving/will is arbitrary
    + Ockham: God's will supersedes his reason
    + now God's reason disappears
+ we are morally unworthy
    + original sin
    + God's morally obligated to extend his wrath on us
+ __salvation__:
    + arbitrary (predestination),
    + but faith is required:
        + nothing else to do, just show your faith as an individual

#### (Cultural) Narcissism

+ self-referential irony:
    + self-obsession separates us
    + attempt of rescuing us from self-obsession
    + we are worthless: self-loathing
         + solution: arbitrary unearned positive regard
         + grammar for cultural narcissism
+ insta likes:
    + `==` unearned amoral positive regard
    + `!=` agape: participation in creation of persons/meaning makers

> In hell people are bound with long spoons on their necks so they cannot feed themselves. There are bowls of food before them at a table. Everyone is starving because they are all demanding to be fed. In heaven the set up is the same, but everyone is happy because they are all feeding each other.

### Protestantism

+ *protest* against Catholicism/authority
     + Church thinks that participation in tradition have an effect on salvation
     + tradition, institution does not matter
     + only individual conscience (self-knowledge):
         + only authority of a person's spiritual life
         + withdrawal of meaning into the isolated individual mind
         + radical idea among cultures
         + individual responsibility/authority
+ cult of authenticity (Adorno):
    + being true to yourself is the ultimate authority by you can judge your life
        + being **true to reality** is superseded by being **true to yourself**

#### Synthesis of Institutions

+ __university__: knowledge, new science
    + state: linked to politics
    + __Bacon__: knowledge is power
+ __monastery__: wisdom, self-transformation
    + Luther: monasteries should be closed down
        + it is an illusion, that we are capable of self-transendence:
            + **sin of pride**
+ loss of *wisdom cultivating* psychotechs:
    + community
        + tradition, practices
    + nowhere to turn for wisdom: **sapiential obsolescence**
        + knowledge bound to the state/politics
            + how to distinguish politics from knowledge (willful assertions)
+ __priesthood of all believers__:
    + direct relationship to god (no priest, no church)
    + translation of the Bible
    + equal spiritual authority, learning tradition doesn't matter
    + democracy *within* the Church
        + but: not political, Luther is against the peasant revolution
    + __two worlds doctrine__:
        + within Church: we don't know who is saved (Gods love)
        + outside world: have to be kept in check (God's wrath)
+ __separation of Church and state__
    + state should not interfere with the Church
    + sacred is private
        + secluded from state and science/university

#### Max Weber's Criticism

+ how do you know if you are saved
	+ provokes anxiety
+ paradox of Luther, *double bind*:
    + rely only on your individual conscience
+ your inner world is self-deception
+ work hard to make your life good
    + if you are succeeding in the world socio-economically:
	    + sign of God's love
+ unofficial way of knowing if you are saved is success
	+ but: no self-promotion (pride)
+ __protestant work ethic__
	+ put back the money into business
	+ advent of capitalism

#### Protestantism Fragments

+ too individual, no tradition
+ disagreements
    + *narcissism of small differences*
        + you are unique
        + (unearned) specialness shows that I'm saved
+ narcissism & fragmentation march together

#### Effects

+ God is withdrawing
+ supernatural is absurd/arbitrary
+ if we don't work hard, that reveals how worthless we are
    + developing hunger for external validation and  specialness
+ __scientific revolution__:
    + cuts you off from the world
+ __Protestant reformation__:
    + cuts you from Church/tradition
+ leading to anxiety, battle of wills, existential dread:

> You are nothing that has to bear it all alone.

## Shakespeare (1564-1616)

+ plumbing the depth of the human psyche profoundly
+ God is absent from his world
    + supernatural is arbitrary/absurd

## Pascal (1623-1662)

+ on cosmos:

> Those infinite spaces terrify me.

## Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650) - Scientific Revolution

+ wants to address of the anxiety of his age:
	+ the *uncertainity*
+ using math to come up with a solution to the *meaning crisis*

#### New Psychotechnologies

+ **Cartesian graph**:
    + story of the tiles and the fly
    + 3 axes: `x, y, z `
+ rise of **analytic geometry**
    + any geometrical shape can be converted into an algebraic equation
	+ Galileo: math doesn't have to share the same gestalt as what they represent
	+ equations capture reality, but they are not *like* what they represent
	    + `F = m*a`
	    + `E = m*c**2`
+ math cuts through the illusions
    + gives us intoxicating **power**
		+ eg. weapons
+ contact the propositional/abstract/symbolic with the fabric of reality
    + is to understand/address the *meaning crisis*:
+ Aristotelian *conformity* gets replaced by propositional *certainty*
+ searching for propositional **certainty**
    + transforming our minds into computational machines
    + representing the world in symbolic propositions
        + and manipulating those logically
    + turning ourselves into computers
+ **reasoning** gets reduced to **computation**

#### Two Pathological Grammars of the Era

+ __Luther__:
    + removes agency in beliefs
        + and thus meaning in life
    + radical self-doubt, **no evidence**
    + narcissism
+ __Descartes__:
    + seeks certainty, **full evidence**
+ increased sense of **disconnectedness**

#### Certainty

+ science cannot provide certainty
    + see the *uncertainty principle*
+ *certainty* is not a solution for **lost connection** with the
    + world
    + ourselves
    + and other minds

## Hobbes (1588-1679)

+ cognition is computation (*ratiocination*)
+ matter is inert substance:
    + resistance of will
    + only thing left from Aristotle's *con-formity*
+ matter is real
+ building a material machine to do computation
    + is *cognition*
+ first to propose AI:
    + `mind == computation`
    + **no spirit** is needed
+ **Galileo kills the universe** (matter is dead)
+ **Hobbes kills the soul**
