## Domicide

+ Hellenism, Alexander the Great, domicide
+ **polis**: agent-arena relationship at its best
+ makes mortality more salient

## Epicuros

    + being anxious about things we cannot control
    + you cannot experience death: where i am death is not
    + afraid of losing agency
    + afraid of losing whats good: meaningful things vs wealth, fame
    + what gives you meaning: friendship
    + happiness is not immortality or money
+ gods are irrelevant

## Diogenes, Cynics

+ influenced by Anthisthenes
+ confrontation, provocative performance art
+ with lamp on the market: looking for an honest man --> moral reflection
+ masturbate publicly --> not immoral
+ eltakarod a napot --> moral reflection
+ diagnosis: we set our heart on things that causes us to suffer
    + man-made, cultural, temporal stuff --> easy to lose by events
    + non-man-made, non-contingent: natural law (living in a barrel) --> live according the patterns of nature
    + natural laws
    + & moral laws:
         + moral principles that are not culturally based
         + vs cultural/historical purity codes: spitting, farting, see parents having sex: not immoral
    + guilt vs shame
    + guilt: broke moral principle
    + shame: broke purity code (clothing malfunction)
    + pull apart purity code from purity code
    + culturally accepted is not necessarily moral
    + meaning vs event
    + we can only control the meaning, not the event (hit by a truck)
+ moral law vs purity code

## Stoics

+ direct ancestral of cognitive therapy
+ diagnosis: anxiety for loss of agency
+ Socrates --> Anthisthenes
    + how to converse with yourself as with Socrates (not rumination)
    + internalize Socrates into your metacognition
    + confrontation of oneself --> transformation
+ interpretation:
+ Zeno: likes Plato: reflection & rational argumentation
    + integration of provocation & reasoning
    + process is also important; process of attachment: how you set your heart
    + process of co-identification (agent & arena relationship)
           + assuming/assigning identities
           + but: have to avoid self-deception, be careful
           + MAR process: mindlessly, automatically, and reactively
    + being social is human (don't leave the polis)
    + culture, politics are variable
