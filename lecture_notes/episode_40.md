# Episode 40 - Wisdom and Rationality

## Recap

+ tentative suggestions on RTNAR
    + **ecology of practices/psychotechs** to address PPs
    + **cogsci worldview** that legitimates/situates that ecology of practices
    + credo and religio and mythos
        + criterion setting in credo (signal vs noise)
        + open-ended/inexhaustible/gnostic mythos
        + mythos is in service of religio
            + propositional (top down) grounded in the participatory knowing
            + afford emergence from participatory (bottom up) to propositional
        + engineering of credo like wiki creation
+ meaning and wisdom
    + wisdom is the meta-virtue
    + the individual pole in the relationship of creating/cultivating of the collective
        meta-psychotech
    + need wisdom before/during/after the quest for enlightenment
        + where enlightenment is the systematic-reliable response to PPs
+ cogsci of wisdom
    + McGee and Barber, 1999: salvage the legacy/philosophical theories of
        the axial age
        + and set them in dialogue with psychological theories of wisdom,
        + converging on a central feature of wisdom:
            + `the systematic seeing through illusion and into reality`
            + systematic insight into a family of problems

## Wisdom

McGee and Barber, 1999

### Wisdom and Insight

Role of systematic insight in the work of Piaget:

+ children make *systematic errors*
    + *constraints* are adaptive in cognition
    + *over-constraining* cognition in the conservation task
+ optimizing and complexifying the system of constraints
    + assimilation and accommodation trade-off
+ children get a *systematic insight* (we have all done it !)
    + qualitative change/development
    + insight into kinds of errors (eg. conservation, egocentrism)
    + insight at the level of *trans*-framing
        + transforming competence
        + *sensibility transcendence*
        + seeing through mis-framing, going through trans-framing

> As the child is to the adult, the adult is to the sage.

+ the sage sees systematically through illusion
+ (Vervaeke: connected to the project of enlightenment)

### The Process of Knowing (How)

+ wisdom is not about *what* you know, but *how* you know it
    + wisdom != product
    + wisdom == process
    + knowledge == product
+ **rationality**: to pay attention to the processing of cognition, not just the
    product
+ J. Kekes:
    + descriptive knowledge
        + grasping the facts
    + interpretive knowledge
        + grasping the significance of what you know (RR) - understanding
+ summary of wisdom so far:
    + what `<` how
    + product `<` process
    + descriptive `<` interpretive knowing
    + grasping the facts `<` significance

### Perspectival/Participatory Aspect to Wisdom

+ *pragmatic self-contradiction*:
    + not a contradiction in *what* you state
    + contradiction in the *perspective from which* you make the statement
        + the degree of identity you have in making the statement
    + eg. `I am asleep.`
        + not a logical/conceptual contradiction
        + uttering it from the perspective of somebody being awake and
            participating in the disclosed fact:
            + pragmatic self-contradiction (not lucid dreaming)
    + eg. `I am wise.`
        + stating that you are wise indicates that you:
            + are in a perspective
            + have an identity
        + which is not being wise
        + Socrates: `I know what I don't know.`
            + wonder -- awe -- horror:
                + horror invokes *humility*
+ wisdom is:
    + not a matter of true beliefs, but
    + what perspectives/identities you can take/assume
+ the world is opening up, and I am opening up to/through it

### Overcoming Self-Deception: Rationality

+ Stenovich: overcoming self-deception/foolishness through **rationality**
+ `rationality != syllogistic reasoning`
+ `rationality != logic`
+ rationality is a capacity to overcome self-deception
    + in a reliable/systematic fashion
        + *reliable*: not a standard of perfection/completion/certainty, but
            with a high probability of functioning successfully
        + *systematic*: not operational in just one domain, but *domain
            general*
            + expertise (high proficiency of skills, and having authority) vs
                rationality
                + expertise does not transfer (eg. tennis to squash (?))
                + expertise is *domain specific*
                + danger of bullshitting ourselves based on similarity of
                    expertise (eg. physics vs metaphysics)
                + rationality applies across many domains
    + affording flourishing through an optimization of cognitive processing
        + achieving a goal through optimization
        + the goals themselves start to shift (A. Callard)
+ rationality is noticing self-deception when doing/engaging in your
    + daily life
    + work
    + friendships/relationships
+ rationality is a continuum: nr of domains you are rational in
    + aspiring to being rational in a domain general way

### The Rationality Debate

+ lot of experimental results seemed to show that human beings are *irrational*

#### Experiment I (Test)

+ lily pads growing on a pond, doubling every day
+ on which day were the lily pads covering half of the pond, if the pond is
    covered fully on day 20
+ people reliably answer: day 10
    + good answer: day 19

#### Experiment II (Test)

+ give people arguments for propositions they strongly (dis)agree with (eg. abortion, capital punishment)
+ proposition `B`
    1. good/logical argument leading to `not B`
    2. bad argument leading to `B`
+ if people strongly believe `B`, they choose `arg 2`
    + being fixated on the *product* of cognition
    + not caring about the *process*
+ *critical detachment*: focusing on the process rather than the product

People generally acknowledge the principle that should be used in these tasks,
but do not apply it.  
+ eg. knowing that you should evaluate an argument independently, otherwise no
    rationality is possible
+ eg. conjunction fallacy, confirmation bias, waste and selection task

#### Experiment III

+ principle: evidence is a basis for my belief
    + if the evidence is proven to be wrong, the belief is false
+ people are given suicide notes, and have to decide whether they are real or
    fake
    + group A is always confirmed whatever they say, and think they are good at
        the task
    + group B is always said they are wrong whatever they say, and think they are bad at
        the task
+ both groups are told that the evidence was wrong
+ in later tasks
    + group A thinks they are good at a related task
    + group B thinks they are bad at a related task
+ people fail to use the principle, and not revise their beliefs

Experiments I-III show that people suffer from systematic
illusion/self-deception.

+ lot of psychologists came to the conclusion that human beings are irrational
+ but if human beings are irrational:
    + democracy is unjustifiable
    + moral/legal responsibility is not possible
        + connecting evidence to belief to action is problematic
+ rationality goes deeply into who and what I am (an existential thing)
    + what political/legal/moral status I can have
+ rationality is associated with wisdom
    + there is an existential/moral/political import of rationality
    + extending/revising the notion of rationality to help us come back to
        wisdom
+ wisdom is deeply associated with meaning
    wisdom is needed to address PPs and historical forces that had driven the
    meaning crisis

#### Debate around Interpreting the Experiments

+ the experiments themselves are robust/reliable/replicable
    + but their interpretation is polemic
+ Cohen:
    + being rational is to follow standards
        + eg. a book does not acknowledge the standards; the book is not
            irrational but *a+rational*
    + source of our normative theory
        + reason/normativity has to be autonomous
            + a divine being giving us commands, and us accepting them is ultimately
                not rational (Plato)
        + we have to posses the standards
            + __we are the source of the standards__
        + reason has to be the source of the norms that constitute and govern
            reason (circular ?)
        + __*ought* implies *can*__
            + applying standards that we have the competence to fulfill
            + eg. cannot always speak all and only what is true
                + everybody has false beliefs
                + standard of certainty is a mistake
    + two kinds of mistakes according to *competence* vs *performance* (based
        on Chomsky):
        + competence exceeds performance
            + in between are implementation processes
        + implementation/performance error
        + source of the normative theory:
            + competence is an ideal implementation free of performance errors
                + a purified/idealized account
                + that is the standard we hold ourselves to
        + __all the errors are performance errors__
            + like slips of tongue
    + as we are the __source of standards__, and we are able to __meet the standards__:
        + we must have at the level of our competence all the rational
            standards
        + at the level of our competence we are rational beings
    + human beings are not irrational
