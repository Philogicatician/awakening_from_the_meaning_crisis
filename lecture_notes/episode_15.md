# Episode 15 - Marcus Aurelius and Jesus

**prosoche**: pay attention to the (judging) process

## event vs meaning (core of cognitive therapies)

+ Epictetus: whats in your control and whats not
     + stabilize meaning, separate from events
     + meaning: framing to the event; modal/existential confusion
          + being vs having mode
              + having mode: things we control: food, shelter
              + being mode: develop agent-arena relationship, maturity
          + modal confusion
              + pursue maturity by having a car
              + pursue love by having sex
      + solution: practice bringing into awareness the event-meaning separation
           + don't try to control the event when you can't
           + procheiron: remembering what to bring into awareness
           + practices: -->

## Marcus Aurelius

+ Meditations: self-help book for himself: can reach meaning in the palace (vs Siddharta)
+ practice exercises:
      + co-transform the world and the self
      + not control and manipulate of the world with power
      + objective seeing:
             + event of sex as skin and fluid
             + meaning of sex; identification, roles
             + smash your fav cup
      + negative visualization (premeditatio): loss of a child
             + meaning vs physics of the child's mortality
      + fatality
            + causal necessity
            + we suffer when meaning and event come apart (like death)
      + the view from above: situate event from far; what matters transforms
            + perspectival change
      + internalize Socrates/inner questioning against bullshitting yourself
+ discern meaning and event, properly calibrate your control --> transform your identity
     + fullness of being, depth of life
     + not immortality, duration
+ wisdom: meaning making, ontological identity <-- awaking experiences

### Logos

+ God's creative logos:
+ "in the beginning there wa logos" <-- John <-- Stoics
+ the word he speaks through the prophets
+ he speaks things into existence
+ the word that helps to create history
+ the word that causes kairos
+ intelligibility, formative principle, underlying structure

### Kairos

+ right timing (<-- chronos), god intervenes
+ God's capacity to create kairos through logos --> incarnated in Jesus
+ Jesus is the ultimate turning point
+ personalized: you can identify with kairos this way
+ ~ Socrates personalizes the axial revolution (direct personal confrontation)

### Metanoia

+ meta: beyond, above
+ noia: noticing
+ radical shifting, conversion, awakening, radical transformation in your salience landscape
+ new mind, new heart, new existence: born again
+ what brings it: love

### Love

+ not an emotion: modal way of being

#### Eros

+ unity, oneness, consuming each other

#### Philia

+ reciprocal cooperation

#### Agape

+ love of the creation, parental/unconditional love, non-person to person
