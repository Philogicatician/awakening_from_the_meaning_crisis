# Episode 11 - Higher States of Consciousness, Part 1

+ HSC: Higher State(s) of Consciousness

## Recap

+ the operation of mindfulness through attentional scaling
    + increasing cognitive flexibility and capacity for insight
+ goal: cogsci account of enlightenment
    + starting with an explanation of HSC
+ the problem of the ontonormativity of HSC
    + why does it feel more real while it does not cohere with everyday consciousness
        + rejecting everyday experience as an illusion
 + consonance with the axial legacy of transcend through illusion, and get connected to more real
    + central to wisdom
    + central to meaning in life

## Theory of the Problem of HSC

Should be:

+ descriptively adequate
    + explanation for
        + why HSC feel more real, connected
        + why HSC produce deep transformations
   + has to work on multiple levels: cognitive, information processing, brain processes
+ prescriptively adequate
   + why is it rationally justifiable that HSC authorize these transformations
+ we want a scientifically plausible explanation of enlightenment

### Descriptive Explanation of HSC

#### Perception of

1. the world:
    + the world seems clear and makes sense
        + increased sense of making sense of things
    + brightness, shining (orig. meaning of glory)
    + attentional scaling:
        + expansion of vision
        + but also capturing fine details
        + eg. Blake: "to see the world in a grain of sand, [...], to hold infinity in the palm of your hand"
    + the world is beautiful, alive, energy
    + underlying oneness, integration
2. the self
    + sense of peace
    + inner harmony: components personality and cognition are optimally working together
    + experience of joy:
        + joy: pos emotion of deep connection to good
    + sense of self changes:
        1. autobiographical self disappears (like in flow)
        2. remembering who you really are, your true self (like sati)
    + energy, vitality (like in flow)
    + insight, understanding (like in flow)
3. the relationship between world and self
    + profound connection inward
    + profound connection to the underlying pattern of the reality
    + profound connection/at-onement between world and self
        + like participating/sharing identity with the reality
            + <-- con-forming (Aristotle) to the underlying reality
    + participatory knowing is so transformative that is ineffable
        + like insight is ineffable (how it emerges)

#### Disruptive Strategies I

+ preceding HSC
+ designed to
    + disrupt normal cognitive functioning
    + alter the state of consciousness
+ long term vs short term strategies
    + long term (years): 
        + mindfulness
    + short term:
       + mind wandering
       + fasting, sleep/sexual deprivation
       + drumming, chanting (shamans)
       + psychedelic
+ decentering as a disruptive strategy
    + shift from first person to third person orientation
    + decrease ego-centric thinking to allocentric
    + eg. describing motion egocentric vs allocentric
    + momentary release from the (super-salient) ego
+ when the brain is engaging in insight there’s a significant shift between the left and the right hemisphere
    + internal disruptive strategy
+ learning psycho-technologies that enhance the disruption
+ the disruptive machinery that’s integral to insight can be exapted and enhanced to bring about a HSC

#### HSC and Insight

+ set up insight
    + breaking frame in order to make a new frame
    + (insight is predictive of meaning in life)
    + experiment: people rate their life more meaningful if primed with meaningful scenes
        + act of making sense, finding coherence makes people experience their life as more meaningful
    + insight in flow --> increased sense of meaning in life
    + insight in HSC: radical sense of deep intelligibility (world and self) --> profound sense of increased meaning in life
+ increased meaning in life & enhanced sense of understanding
    + if that guides you in improving your life:
    + --> build __confidence__ in you, that you have found a path toward self-transcendence and wisdom

#### Fluency Heuristic

+ fluency: general property of all cognitive processing
+ "ease" at processing information
    + more fluent processing --> more confidence, truth value regardless of the semantic content
    + eg. processing text better if text color and background contrast is greater

+ not just *ease* of processing, rather
    + how *accessible* info is
    + how well your system is zeroing in on relevant info
    + how well the info has been formatted to you
+ psychotechs
    + alphabetic literacy made cognitive  processing more fluent
        + improved cognitive power
        + better sense of how real and important info is
+ when you are fluent you are processing info efficiently

Insight is a fluency spike: 

+ increase in the fluency of processing
+ judge the info processed as more likely to be real
    + picking up on the real patterns
+ caveat: the fluency heuristic is not an universal rule
    + but domain general

#### Continuity Hypothesis

We want a scientifically plausible explanation of enlightenment/radical self-transcendence.

Moving towards HSC:

+ the same machinery is used, but it is being __exapted__ throughout into more powerful processing

1. increasing fluency -->
    + mind is working efficiently
2. increasing insight -->
    + implicit learning is picking up on complex patterns
    + zero in on causal patterns
3. enhanced in flow experience -->
    + at-onement
    + loss of self
    + lot of energy used but feels effortless
    + super salience
    + intrinsically rewarding
    + domain general
    + requires expertise/skill
    + Newberg: little enlightenment experiences
        + lot of mindfulness practice is priming you to mystical experiences
        + (mindfulness is predictive of insight and flow)
4. mystical experience -->
5. transformative experience

Question: what experience/skill is flowing/involved/used in HSC ? What process is being optimized ?

+ Dreyfus: **optimal grip**; perception example:
    + when perceiving a new object, we move around it to get into the optimal tradeoff relationship
        + tradeoff: between details and gestalt (zooming in and out)
        + optimal is relative to the situation
    + ~ con-formity theory (Aristotle)
+ E. Rosch: optimal grip ~ the way we use categories
    + basic-level categories (prototype), eg. cat and dog
        + not mammal (superordinate, hypernym), and not spaniard (subordinate, hyponym)
        + default is the basic level: in perception, in learning by children
        + basic level is the cognitively optimal grip
            + tradeoff between feature and gestalt (attention scaling), eg. reading

Answer: in HSC people are flowing in their ability to optimally grip the world and the self (opening up and zeroing in) - not intellectually.

+ the flow state of the optimal gripping

#### Mind Wandering

as a natural disruptive strategy:

+ in moderation improves cognitive flexibility by breaking up fixated patterns
    + --> enhances the capacity for insight
+ hardwired into us

#### De-automatization of Cognition

+ breaking down frames, scaling down attention
+ eg. 9-dot problem:
    + bad frame: square --> blocks you from solving the problem

#### (In)variation

+ disruptive strategies increase variation/noise/entropy in your processing
    + increasing variation in what you are paying attention to
    + increasing the activated processed in the brain
    + --> get more awareness on what's **invariant**/not changing
        + eg. walking around, touching an object preserves its shape (more or less)
+ good vs bad invariants:
    + good: pickin up on real patterns in the world
    + bad: blocking the new framing
+ Kaplan & Simon: **Notice Invariants Heuristic**:
    + change what you have not changed in all your failed problem formulations
+ systematic errors and variation:
     + during development kids find systematic patterns of errors, have systematic insight, and go through developmental change that address the whole system of errors
     + increasing variation helps zeroing in on systematic errors (for adults too) that afford developmental change
         + child --> adult --> sage

## Axial Age Legacy

+ we do not believe in the two-world mythology
+ but need to salvage the psychotechs of intervention/self-transcendence/self-transformation/wisdom-cultivation
    + that bring harmony within and connectedness to the world
