# Episode 45 - The Nature of Wisdom

## Recap

+ wisdom is connected to the project of meaning in life
+ Baltes & Stadinger criticisms
+ Ardelt's theory of wisdom
    + *having* knowledge about wisdom vs *being/becoming* wise
    + cognitive, reflective, affective dimensions of personhood
        + cognitive: understanding and grasping the significance (Kekes): invoking RR
        + reflective: connection with perspectival knowing and the cultivation of rationality
        + affective: ties to agape and RR, connects to meaning in life
        + criticism: not a process theory
            + no independent account of foolishness
            + no process on becoming wise (not picking up on the ancient heritage)
+ Sternberg's theory of wisdom
    + balance of *adapting, shaping, selecting* the env invokes RR
    + tacit knowledge/implicit processing/intuitive grasping/understanding
    + balancing intra/inter/extra-personal interests
        + connection to meaning in life
    + invoking *balance* as optimization (like in RR processing)
    + criticism:
        + being directed to the *common good* is anachronistic
        + unclear connection to *values*; ambiguity:
            + wise person is regulated by normativity (considerations of what is *true, good, beautiful*)
                + tautology
            + or specific values are being invoked, but not explained
        + product theory
            + no independent account of foolishness

## Vervaeke & Ferraro (2013)

### Model of Kinds of Knowings I

#### 4 Cardinal Ancient Greek Virtues

1. wisdom (meta-virtue)
2. justice
3. courage
4. *sophrosyne* (temperance, moderation) 
    + "Everything in moderation"
    + golden mean: a virtual engine that generates enabling/selective constraints
        + optimization
    + contrasted with *eukratia*
        + *kratia*: law, power
        + *eu*: self
        + self-restraint/control
+ practicing a virtue *sophrosyne*-ically or *eukratia*-ically
    + T trying not to lie, but feels the temptation
        + practices self-restraint/eukratia
    + S cannot lie
        + sees the possibility, but lying is not a viable option, no temptation
        + honesty is second nature to S: sophrosyne
            + an adult has different salience landscape than a child, not tempted by the same things
            + `As the child is to the adult, the adult is to the sage.`
            + the salience landscape of the sage is so that they are not tempted by self-deception as the adult
+ *sophrosyne* is to have a *salience landscape* that has gone through a fundamental reversal
    + less oriented towards the adult's self-deception
    + the sage has trained enough that they can just let things unfold naturally
    + Augustine: `love God and do what you want`
        + when you have agape flowing through you, then you have sophrosyne:
            + you will be tempted to the good
    + when being wise, your salience landscape naturally self-organizes towards
        + seeing through illusion
        + zeroing on relevant info on how to become more virtuous and having a more meaningful life

#### Model of Competences and Kinds of Knowing

+ **inferential** competence (S2)
    + **propositional** knowing
    + enhanced and protected from S1 by the *cognitive style* of **AOM**
        + foregrounded in theoretical contexts
    + overcoming *fallacious reasoning*
    + knowledge of facts
        + cross-contextual patterns
        + grasping of *principles* (sophia)
+ **insight** competence (S1)
    + construal (**procedural** knowing)
    + skills of attention
    + developed by **mindfulness**
        + foregrounded in existential/therapeutic contexts
        + mindfulness as a *cognitive style* that coordinates psychotechs together
            + eg. meditation, contemplation, flow interaction with the environment
        + overcoming *misframing/misconstrual*
    + knowledge of events/processes
        + grasping of processes (phronesis)
+ how to coordinate the two competences ?
    1. self-organizing opponent processing or
    2. with **perspectival** knowledge
        + internalization of other people's perspective
        + integrates/synthesizes propositional/principles/theories and procedural/processes/skills
        + higher order regulation of AOM and mindfulness
        + *cognitive style*: **internalizing the sage**
        + overcoming *egocentrism*
        + realizing the virtue of *sophrosyne*
            + optimization of perspectival knowing
                + in service of the development of the agent-arena relationship affording self-transformation
        + deep connection between *wisdom* and *sophrosyne*
+ *sophrosyne* is directed towards the 3 M's:
    + *morality*:
        + not just knowing the rules, but the capacity of being virtuous
    + realizing *meaning in life*
        + self-determination theory
    + *mastery*
        + capacity for caring/coping with reality
        + applying rules and roles with care

#### Smmmary

competence | inferential | insight | internalization
--- | --- | --- | ---
knowing | propositional | procedural | perspectival
cognitive style / cultivation of | AOM | mindfulness | internalizing the sage
foregrounding context | theoretical | therapeutic | 
knowledge of | facts/principles (sophia) | events/processes (phronesis) | sophrosyne
overcoming | fallacious reasoning | misframing/misconstrual | egocentrism

#### Core Argument

+ wisdom is a comprehensive optimization of
    + cognition
        + by **enhancing RR**
    + consciousness
    + character
+ convergence on RR

#### Wisdom and Love

+ gaining theoretical/procedural knowledge the best possible way
+ the wise person knows how to *believe well*
+ overcoming egocentrism
    + internalizing the sage
    + becoming sophrosynic
        + by agape

#### Criticism:

+ no clear/explicit discussion of participatory knowing
    + a *process theory* needs an account how one goes through:
        + *transformational experience/development*,
        + existential/modal change
+ missing connection between *wisdom* and
    + transformative experience
    + HSC
+ deficit of realizing *meaning in life*
        + self-determination theory needs improvement
+ wisdom is not connected to *gnosis*/participatory
+ not well developed relationship between the kinds of knowing
+ missing account of *understanding*

### Model of Kinds of Knowings II

+ relationship of the kinds of knowings:
    + *propositional* is grounded in
    + *procedural* (knowing how to interact and apply skills), which is grounded in
    + *perspectival* (situational awareness to cultivate the skills), which is grounded in
    + *participatory*: agent-arena attunement that affords you being in the world and go through existential change

## Convergence Arguments of Theories of Wisdom

+ converging onto RR
    + coming out aspects of human spirituality
    + including wisdom
    + *naturalistic account* of wisdom
+ intelligence
+ rationality
+ different kinds of knowing
    + integrating/optimizing them

## Model/Theory of Understanding

+ `understanding != knowledge`
+ `understanding != possessing an explanation`
+ zeroing in on relevant info by
    + being *insightful*
    + avoiding *bias* and *fallacy* at inference
    + overcoming *egocentrism*
+ wisdom should also account for *profound understanding*
    + Vervaeke has no fully developed account of understanding, it is WIP
        + which cognitive style is used ?
        + how it connects to participatory knowing ?
+ Kekes: grasping the significance of the knowledge
+ Smedslund: grasping the relevance of what you know

#### Connection to Construal

+ *construal*: problem formulation (and RR within)
    + a really *good construal*: **optimal grip**
    + good *contact*

#### Connection to Problem Finding

+ problem finding & problem nexus
    + finding new domains
+ de Regt & Cysbergt (2017a: the *standard of effectiveness* for understanding)
    + `understanding != grasping the truth`
        + most people's beliefs are false
        + truth is not not important
        + but better tie understanding to *rationality*
            + using the best *methods* for getting the truth
        + eg. in science we use false representations to generate understanding (`map != territory`)
            + **effective** way to grasp the significance/relevant implications of the model
    + understanding is *contextually sensitive*: relative to the situation/person at hand

#### Basic and Profound Understanding

+ *multi-aptness*: good *problem formulation* transfers to good *problem finding*
+ *trustworthiness*: convergence to good *problem formulation*
    + lot of work on overcoming self-deception
+ *basic* understanding:
    + to grasp the relevant implications/connections
+ *profound* understanding:
    + __horizontal axis__: when basic understanding is used to generate **plausibility**
        + `plausibility: elegance + convergence`
    + __vertical axis__: kinds of knowing interacting

----------------

+ the account of understanding needs to be integrated into the account wisdom
+ the account of transformational experience/gnosis needs to be integrated into the account of wisdom

## Transformative Experience/Knowing

### Sudden

+ insight
    + **inspiration**
+ L.A. Paul

### Incremental/Gradual

#### A. Callard: Aspiration (2016)

+ supplementing sudden transformative experience
+ eg. joining a music appreciation class
    + paradox of how to be a good student
+ no inferential way through
+ acquiring appreciation by **aspiration** 
    + rational process: *proleptic* (anticipatory) rationality
        + to become a different person by going through the transformative experience
            + cannot acquire perspectival/participatory by an inferential process

> My loving of wisdom cannot itself be an irrational process.

+ process of identity change
    + having a placeholder/symbol to: *value of aspiration* for music appreciation
        + connects the present you to the future you
        + entering the liminal place where starting to appreciate music
            + symbolic enactment, gnosis
    + *value of music appreciation* rises
        + can give up the placeholder
+ similar to sophrosyn
+ deep connection to *wonder*
    + like Socratic *aporia*
+ `philia+sophia`: aspiring for wisdom
+ criticism:
    + still need a psychological account of aspiration

## Summary

+ need an account of understanding/gnosis/aspiration
    + and integrate them into the account of wisdom
+ what is wisdom ?

> Wisdom is an ecology of psycho-technologies, an ecology of cognitive styles that dynamically/reciprocally constrain and optimize each other, such that an overall optimization/enhancement of RR. RR within inference/insight/internalization/understanding/gnosis/transformation/aspiration.

+ wisdom is a dynamical system counter-active to the machinery of self-deception,
    + that helps to afford the self-organizing transformation into the life
        + of flourishing
        + that is meaningful
+ task remaining: connect the notion of wisdom back to
    + enlightenment
    + awakening from the meaning crisis
