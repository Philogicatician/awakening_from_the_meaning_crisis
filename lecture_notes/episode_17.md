# Episode 17 - Gnosis and Existential Inertia

+ sense of inner conflict:
    + losing agency
    + at war with oneself, suffering
        + cosmic forces aligned with it

i## Gnostics

+ axial revolution within the axial revolution
+ culmination

### Gnosis

+ understanding, belief --> worldview
+ sensibility transcendence
    + mother in law story: coarse --> spontaneous

## Existential Inertia

+ inability to enter into, make viable a new way of being
    + cannot do it by thinking about it inferentially
    + leading to existential inertia
+ I know what I should do to become, but cannot do it
+ being stuck, circling back to the same patterns over and over, losing agency
+ I want to get there (will), but I don't know how
+ other worldview, other self
+ missing participatory knowing, perspectival knowing (propositional knowing is there)
    + turning to **therapy**
    + therapist is affording an agapic transformation

## Transformation

+ if you never try you never know
+ examples: new fruit, new relationship, having a child
+ risk to the agent-arena relatioship:
    + what you miss vs what you lose
    + role playing games: bleed: liminal place between two worlds (normal vs sacred)
    + we have to recover serious play
        + from religious rituals
    + get existentially un-trapped --> enacting reframing in therapy
    + shift in worldview --> make it viable --> through anagoge (ascent, plato)

### Gnosis as Participatory Knowing

+ get into a higher state of consciousness (chanting, sleep deprivation, psychedelics)
     + flow within a ritual context,
         + enactive anagoge analogy
         + serious play --> cognitive flexibility
     + integration of psychotechs
     + freeing from being existentially stuck --> transform perspectival & participatory knowing
     + heals us from the fragmented agency, brokenness
