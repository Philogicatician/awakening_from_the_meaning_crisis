# Episode 48 - Corbin and the Divine Double

## Recap

+ Heidegger as prophet of the MC
+ `the thing beyond itself`; simultaneously
    1. shining in into our framing
    2. withdrawing from our framing
+ truth as *alethea*:
    + grounds the agent-arena relationship in *attunement*
    + potential to remember *Being*
    + but also to deeply forget it, leading to *modal confusion*
+ history of *metaphysics* as emergence of *nihilism*
    + trapped into the *having mode*
    + in which metaphysics is a propositional project of
        + truth as correctness
        + misunderstanding *Being* as a particular being
        + capturing the unlimited aspect of *Being* at the limit:
            + understanding *Being* as a *supreme being* at the limit: *ontotheology*
+ ontotheology and nihilism are enmeshed
    + understanding Being in a theist frame, gets us into *forgetfulness/modal confusion*, which are the hallmark of nihilism
+ Corbin: remembering the being mode as **gnosis**
    + what is it like to remember from the being mode through alethea *Being* ?
    + gnosis as serious play

## Heidegger and Gnosis

+ in the works of Avens, Caputo:
    + H's commentary on the poetry of Angelus Silesius, a mystic poet
+ Angelus Silesius puts Meister Eckhart's work into poetry
    + gnosis: remembering the being mode through alethea
        + for Eckhart this is a form of *sacredness*

### Physis

> The rose is without 'why';
> It blooms, because it blooms.
> It cares not for itself,
> Asks not if it is seen.

+ `physis`: gr. growth/blossoming forth, basis of *physics*
    + the verb stem *phy-* or *bhu-* (growing) is a cognate of the English *to be*
+ for H re-experiencing the *physical* is a way of remembering the being mode
+ H's comment on the poem:

> The blossoming of the rose is grounded in itself, has its ground in itself. The blossoming is a pure emerging out of itself.

+ pure emerging: pure *shining*
    + not explicit here, but *withdrawing* is implied in *emerge*

#### Horizontal vs Vertical Narrative 

+ Eckhart's maxim: `Live without why.`
    + the quest for the grand purpose is coming from the *having mode*
    + Eckhart is proposing a non-theological way of being
+ there is no narrative to the rose
    + above/beyond the narrative
+ teleological aspect to the physical universe
    + axial heritage
+ maybe the *universe* is like the *rose*
    + grounded in itself
    + blooming/blossoming/shining from itself
        + and always withdrawing
+ maybe we get better connected with the *physis* of the universe if we drop the axial age requirement that there be a teleological narrative to it all
    + __horizontal narrative__: cognitive/existential practice of *non-logical identity*
        + relationship to the **symbol**:
            + framing `-->` transframing: non-logical identity between the self/world inside and outside the frame
            + represents a non-logical identity through time (like from baby to adult self)
                + fundamental transformation
+ we can *exapt* the ability for non-logical identity (*horizontal narrative*)
    + and do the *vertical ontology* in which we connect the depths of ourselves/*self* to the depths of *Being*
        + in a non-teleological *being mode*
+ **pure shining** (phenomenon/experience) is
    + RR: the salience landscaping into intelligibility
+ **pure withdrawal**
    + independent inexhaustibleness of the comb explosive reality
        + `the thing beyond itself`
        + like the dao is a well that is never used up: the inexhaustible mother
            + symbol: yinyang; black and white in each other, sinuous/interpenetrating
+ connecting the *shining* and *withdrawal* together:

> A trajectory of transframing that is always closing upon the relevant, while always opening to the moreness.

+ recognition/celebration of the above is *sacredness*
    + H does not talk about the shining-withdrawing in terms of sacredness; Tillich does
+ realness as *tonos*
    + gr. *tonos*: tension/strain/pitch/srtess/accent
    + creative (polar) tension between *confirmation/coherence* and *moreness*
        + assimilation/closure/homing & accommodation/opening/numinous (eg. in VR, the dao symbol yinyang)
    + the serious play of Being: *gnosis* (Corbin)

## Corbin

+ influenced by
    + Heidegger
    + Neoplatonic tradition
    + **Persian Sufism**
        + Persian philosophy is central to the history of philosophy in the world (connecting European-Arab-Asiatic worlds)
        + fraught history of Persia: Arab invasion that was a genocide
            + Persians were attracted to a mystical interpretation of Islam: Sufism
            + form of liberation
        + Corbin is an insightful/important (not perfect) interpreter of Sufism
+ difficult to read, like poetry, recite and repeat
+ explaining *gnosis* through the influences:
    + salvic/redemptive/transformative/participatory knowing
    + deep at-onement
    + influence of Sufism: 
        + the recovery of gnosis is bound up with *imagination*

### Imagination

+ Avens, Lachman, Cheetham
+ *imaginary* vs *imaginal*

#### Imaginary

+ subjective experience of generating inner mental imagery, which know is not real 
    + in our control

#### Imaginal

+ bound up with gnosis
+ important to understand to understand Jung's *active imagination*
    + Corbin is more open about Jung's influence on him, than vice versa

```
                  abstract intelligible world
                             |
                             |
                             |
subjective    _______     imaginal     _______       objective
                             |
                             |
                             |
                    concrete sensible world
```

+ in my phenomenological experience the is an *intelligible* order that I can abstract intellectually
+ the *intelligible order* affects the way I come into sensual contact with thing
+ the Cartesian cultural grammar replicates the *axial two worlds* within us:
    1. mind - abstract
    2. body/pure matter - sensible
+ the *imaginal* mediates/bridges between
    + the *mind* and the *material*
    + the *subjective* and the *objective*
+ the **imaginal** is
    + *transjective*
    + constant transformative transframing
    + in motion
    + use of images *transjectively* (not *subjectively*) in a way that it mediates/integrates the
        + abstract intelligible world and
        + concrete sensible world

#### Fundamentalism and Literalism

+ criticism/opposition to __fundamentalism/literalism__
    + they __freeze__ the imaginal:
        + then they make the transformative transframing *static*
    + they __fracture__ the imaginal:
        + they put things *just* into abstract/sensible/subjective/objective
    + they lose the nexus of the imaginal
+ if you lose the *imaginal*
    + (if) you lose the capacity for *gnosis*
        + you lose the capacity for waking up within the *being mode* through *alethea* to *Being* and the ground of being in *sacredness*
+ the opposition of fundamentalism/literalism is not explicit in **Heidegger**
    + gets explicated in **Corbin**
    + deep component of **Jung**
        + literalism is the antithetical movement of thought and being in the world to everything that he is trying to promote as a response to the meaning crisis
    + antagonistic to **Barfield**'s poetic participation
+ H's critique of ontotheology
    + to *have* the *supreme being*, to *have* propositions about it in a fundamentalist/literalist fashion
    + losing *Being*, modal confusion
+ fundamentalism/literalism dismisses the *symbol* as without relevance/importance

### Symbol

+ bringing back the gnosis of the symbol (Corbin, Pageau)
    + not interpret it as merely abstract/sensible/subjective/objective
+ bringing out the *imaginal* in a way that connects with *dasein*
    + self-knowledge and participatory knowing of being is interpenetrating
+ sense of *sacredness* going on within the *imaginal*
+ *imaginal* vs *imaginary* understanding of the symbol

#### Features of the Imaginal Symbol

+ **translucent**: looking *at* and looking *through/beyond* 
    + eg. glasses: looking by means of it and beyond it
    + the two are in dialogue:
        + helping to capture the *non-logical identity* between
            + the agent-arena in *this* frame and the agent-arena in a more *comprehensive/encompassing frame
+ *transjective*:
    + not subjective, nor objective: those are the *having mode* dismissal
        + the symbol challenges you to transcendence
    + if you are not transcending in response to a symbol, you have not understood the symbol
        + the symbol is not just an allegory
        + remembering/alethea through the symbol
            + literalism: forgetting alethea in the pursuit of correctness of truth
+ **trajective**:
    + the symbol is putting you in a trajectory of transformation
+ **transformative**
+ **transtemporal, transpatial**:
    + the movement between worlds is not narrative (temporal-spatial), it is an ontological movement/shift
        + between a smaller frame and a larger frame

#### The Angel and the Divine Double

+ not the cultural *imaginary* sense
    + decadent Romantic notion/*motif* (Rousseau):
        + you are born with your true self, and you have express it, and be authentic
+ Stang: Our Divine Double
    + *motif* in the Mediterranean world, Gnosticism, early Christianity, Neoplatonism
    + I have my self/psyche now, but it is bound to the *divine double*:
        + a *double* of me that is archetypically more important than me
        + my spiritual path is to reunite *this self* with the *divine double*: mystical union
+ the concept of *divine double* is gnostic:
    + transgressive: trying to break the grammar that your *true self* is sth you already *have*
    + instead: your *true self* is beyond you, and you have to *aspire* to it
    + Socratic element: your *true self* is sth to be realized through the *being mode* of self-transcendence
        + not through the *having mode* of inner position
+ the *divine double* is a pervasive mythos
    + literalize the mythos to an axial two-world mythology
+ recommendation to understand Corbin's use of *The Angel* as the *divine double*
    + considering the process of aspiration  towards a better self

__Process of Aspiration towards a Better Self__:

+ normative improvement of the self (Socrates, Maslow, Jung)
+ *divine double*: why did so many different groups of people in that world believe it ?
    + L.A. Paul: transformative experience (bound up with gnosis)
        + rapid transition between `self1` and `self2`
            + insight
    + A. Callard: aspiration
        + there is a neglected *form of rationality* that is best understood by *aspiration*
            + proleptic rationality
            + where *rationality* is: any systematically reliable internalized psychotech, that affords you overcoming self-deception, cultivating enhanced connectedness/meaning in life
                + culminates in the cultivation of wisdom
                + more than just the logical management of argumentation
        + transition between `self1` and `self2` is developmental:
            + qualitative development as a set of insightful transformations
    + no inconsistency between rapid and developmental transition
+ *qualitative development*: fundamental difference in competence (knowing/doing/being)
    + logical identity: `A == A`
    + **non-logical identity**:
        + gnosis: we cannot reason/infer/deliberate our way through it
    + the nature of the relation between `self1` and `self2` is **aspirational**
+ *aspiration* is part of a *rational* process
    + my relationship to rationality/wisdom are aspirational
    + when the aspiration to rationality is not part of rationality, it is a self-refutation
    + the aspiration to rationality is constitutive of the ongoing process of being rational
    + the aspiration to rationality must be included in the notion of rationality
    + Platonic idea of the __interpenetration of *love* and *reason*__
+ *liberal education* is designed to make you into a better self
    + to save/liberate you from existential entrapment: **gnosis**
    + you don't know what it is going to be like

Self1 | Self2
--- | ---
existing self | divine double

+ the divine double is a *symbol* (in Corbin's sense) that allows you to move from your *self now* to *self then*; to a better self
    + eg. music appreciation: 
        + I do not currently get calssical music
        + but I have an *inkling* that there is a *self* and a *world* there
            + acquired *taste*: taking it deeply in
    + how to bridge between the two selves ?
        + Corbin's talk about the angel integrates symbolism and the process of aspirational rationality
        + aspirational rationality is central for self-transcendence, becoming more rational/wise
