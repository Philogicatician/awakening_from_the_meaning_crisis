# Episode 28 - Convergence To Relevance Realization

relevance realization: RR
general problem solver: GPS

## Intelligence: capacity to be a general problem solver
Newell & Simon:
+ applying the naturalistic imperative to avoid circular explanation of the mind: analyze, formalize, mechanize --> re-situate the mind within the scientific worldview
+ criticism: heuristic of essentialism --> bias of all problems are essentially the same;
     + problems are very different, most of them ill-defined
     + task is to re-formulate/frame ill-defined problems
         + missing RR in ill-defined problems
         + RR helps you avoid combinatorial explosion
         + insight: bad --> good problem formulation

### Insight is needed to be a rational, cognitive agent (+ logic)
+ psychotechs to practice insight
+ re-framing/formulation, break out
+ avoid comb explosion
+ ill-defined --> well-defined (eg. mutilated chessboard: covering --> parity strategy)
+ self-correction: limit nr of salient things

## Categorization
+ capacity that increases the ability of dealing in the world:
     * 2 markers as the same category
+ speeds up
     * making predictions
     * extract relevant info
     * communication
+ central to intelligence
+ sense of things belonging together != essence
+ Nelson Goodman:
    * sense of similarity
        - logical: partial identity
               + sharing features --> comb explosion of features
        - psychological
               + zero in on relevant, salient features (not truth)
               + not stable: kids, wife, gasoline <-- fire is dangerous to them
+ pushback on RR
   + Darwin: survival situation
        + avoid danger
        + what is danger, what are the features
        + Daniel Dennett: mobile robot example as a cognitive agent (not just generating behavior)
             + ability to determine the consequences of your behavior and change it accordingly
             + wagon & robot problem: battery & bomb & handle
                    + check for intended effect
                    + factor in side effects --> comb explosion, proliferation
                    + adding the definition of relevance (hypothetical) --> comb explosion of listing relevant features
--> RR: ignore info, not even check it
+ frame problem --> relevance problem remains after solving it
     + consciousness/working is where we deal with relevance

## Communication
+ crucial to intelligence
+ language
+ Grace:
    + conveying much more than what you are actually saying
    + relying on the listener for deriving the things implied: implicature (not logical):
    
```
"Excuse me ! I'm out of gas."
"There is a gas station at the corner."
"Thank you!"
``` 
    
         
+ many implications in the above conversation, eg. I: the car; gas: gasoline; out of: not completely out of
+ comb explosion of the things conveyed --> relying on people read between the lines (inter legere)
+ maxims of communication:
    1. maxim of quality (truth)
    2. maxim of quantity (right amount)
    3. maxim of manner (being helpful)
    4. maxim of relevance
          
+ Sperber and Wilson: only 4. matter; 1-3. can be reduced to 4.
    3. manner: make salient what's relevant
    2. quantity: give relevant amount of info
    1. quality, truth: (truth != relevance): we don't demand truth --> we ask for honesty: what you believe to be true
        + honesty: convey what is relevant to the context, conversation
+ ability to communicate: RR of information

## Convergence argument
+ core of intelligence: RR
+ selective attention (in working memory) --> comb explosion of problem space and side effects --> organize, categorize info (long-term memory organization, access) --> feeds back to selective attention and all
+ --> relevance problem

#### RR: machinery of salience, motivation, attention (top-down, bottom up), energy arousal --> involving
+ analyze, formalize, mechanize
+ use RR in a multi-apt fashion
    + explain what is crucial to wisdom, self-transcendence, meaning
    + RR is crucial to insight
    + insight is crucial to wisdom, meaning making:
         + zero in on relevant info in an ill-defined situ
         + pay attention to the relevant consequences, side effects
         + remember similar situs from the past
    + RR is crucial to attention, altering state of consciousness
    + RR and self-transcendence:
        + RR helps overcome self-deception --> systematic insight
    + RR and meaning; proposal:
        + lost orders (NNN) afforded connections between mind and
             + body
             + mind
             + world
             + itself (fragmentation of mind)
       + relationship between salience and truth
             + what we find relevant connects up to reality
             + connects parts of us together in the right way (Plato)
       + how we find things relevant to us (connection between parts of us), to each other
             + not causal connection, but establishing relations of relevance between things
             + RR: make connections that are at the core of meaning threatened by the meaning crisis
             + regenerate psychotechs cultivating wisdom, self-transcendence, connection to each other and the world
