# Episode 10 - Consciousness

## Recap

+ how mindfulness leads to a modal/systematic insight
    + that transforms the agent-arena relationship
    + that affords existential distress and enhanced meaning
+ machinery of attention; attentional scaling
    + transparency-opacity shift, breaking up gestalt into features - scaling down; meditation
    + opacity-transparency shift, feature to gestalt/better frame - scale up; contemplation
    + fluency and flowing between the two, optimize between them -->
         + prajna, non-duality that can transform the agent-arena relationship
         + mystical/transformative experience: enhanced realness, meaning etc.

## What is an Altered State of Consciousness ?

### What is consciousness ?

+ nature of consciousness:
    + how does it emerge from the brain/matter
+ David Chalmers: the hard problem of consciousness
    + to explain consciousness
        + where does consciousness come from ?
+ full explanation is out of scope here
+ knowing conscious == being conscious
    + you participate in your consciousness
+ many of your (complex) cognitive processes are not conscious:
    + eg. speech

#### Integrated Information Theory (IIT) - Tononi

+ how integrated pieces of info are
    + how one piece of info is interacting/causally dependent on other info
    + more tight integration --> more powerful/complex processing


### What are the properties, what is the function of consciousness ?

#### Global Workspace Theory (GWT) - Baars

+ consciousness ~ desktop of compute
        + bring unconscious processes to conscious like working memory (WM)
        + infos interact
    + broadcast back the changes
+ select relevant info --> bring them together --> transform them --> broadcast the changes back
+ this architecture can solve the *frame problem*
+ zero in on relevant info
    1. overwhelming amount of info available to me in every moment
    2. overwhelming amount of info in my memory
    3. have to put 1) and 2) together
    + --> we have to select and use it in a relevant way
    + <-- consciousness is doing that
        + consciousness -- working memory -- intelligence

#### Core Function of Consciousness

+ dynamic improvement of realize/actualize/zero in on relevant info

#### Neurosci Account of Consciousness

+ consciousness correlates with certain kinds of brain activity
    + chunking info
    + restructuring info
    + (like in insight !)

#### Integrated Information Theory (IIT) - Tononi

+ how much I'm picking up on patterns (making sense) in the world
+ trying to track the complexity of the world
+ function: to allow to determine which info are relevant to each other and to me

#### Relevance Realization (RR) and Consciousness

+ not every instance of relevance realization (RR) is consciousness

> Consciousness is a way in which you can coordinate attention and other related abilities of awareness to optimize how insightfully you can make sense of your world.

+ need consciousness for situations
    + that require insight
    + that are novel
    + that are challenging
+ can reduce consciousness in situations
    + that are well-defined problems
    + no novelty
    + no insight

+ when altering the state of consciousness, we alter what we are finding relevant/salient

#### Consciousness and the Salience Landscape (SL)

**Sizing up**:

1. picking out features: **featurization**
2. prioritizing: **foregrounding**, backgrounded
3. create a figure of the foregrounded features (con-**figuring**)
4. **framing** problems

+ dynamical system: all feeding back on each other
+ salience landscape is in constant flux
+ the agent is optimizing between feature and gestalt until finding an optimal grip
    + when adjusting in the SL, an affordance opens up
        + **affordance** (Gibson): the cup is graspable for me:
            + not a property of the cup
            + not a property of my hand
            + setting up a coordination between the constraints of the cup and my hand, so I can engage in an interaction
            + co-identifying between agent and arena
+ we don't see colors and shapes --> we see affordances
    + the cup is graspable
    + the floor is walkable
    + the desk is placeable/moveable

#### What consciousness is doing

1. salience landscape
2. optimal gripping (sizing up)
3. presence landscape
    + creating affordances (affordance network): where agent and arena are co-identified
    + the cup is presenting itself to me, and I'm presenting myself to the cup
4. depth landscape
    + differentiating between causal and correlational patterns
    + contact the depths of the world
5. significance landscape

+ highly dynamical process

### Transforming Consciousness

+ transforming the
    + salience landscape
    + presence landscape
    + depth landscape
+ agent and arena are going to be radically transformed
+ systematic insight *of* consciousness

### Childhood Development (Piaget)

+ wisdom metaphor:
    + child ~ adult == adult ~ sage
+ systematic errors are telling
    + there is a pattern on the errors
    + --> they are *constraints* operating in the child's cognition
+ constraints shape the child's sensori-motor interaction with the world
+ development is how the constraints are shifting

#### Experiment

+ 5 candies

```
1.  OOOOO
2. O O O O O
```

+ kids are consistently picking the 2. row
+ underlying constraints:
     + more space: more salient (in the SL)
          + different sizing up
          + different affordances: presence landscape
     + for the adult the extra space is not relevant (in the SL)
          + the adult's SL has been trained to see multiple variables at the same time
          + seeing through the self-deceptive illusion

+ super-salient stuff trigger bullshitting and self-deception
    + changing the SL protects from illusions and self-deception

#### Systematic Insights

+ system of error:
    + the SL has not been sufficiently cultivated yet
    + isolated insights don't matter
+ systematic insights are insight *of* consciousness not *in* consciousness
+ changing/transforming the SL, presence landscape and depth landscape --> systematic improvement of relevance, insight
    + getting wise: wisely zero in on relevant info and make life more meaningful
    + change the significance landscape
        + affords you to see through illusion into reality
        + affords you to have a more comprehensive flowing relation to reality
+ altered state of consciousness have to potential to systematic insight
    + bit can also make you more prone to illusion
+ why are some altered states of consciousness more real ?

### Problem Formulation

+ some altered/higher states of consciousness (HSC) are more real
    + agent: this is who I really am
    + arena: this is what the world really is
+ prescriptive:
    + motivation to transform everyday experience to be more consonant with the "more real"
    + taps into both Platonic meta drives:
        + inner harmony (real self)
        + connection to the world (real world)
+ problem of **ontonormativity**
    + onto: structure of reality
    + normative: demand to be better/improve
+ question: why is the ontonormativity of HCS problematic ?
    + the transformative changes are justified by HCS & ontonormativity
    + but this is in contrast how we treat/reject the other altered states of consciousness (dream, being drunk)
        + the pattern of the dream doesn't *cohere* with the rest of your life
        + it is not intelligible --> not real
            + <-- Plato: realness is the pattern of intelligibility with the widest scope
            + coherence of content: most sense of most of your experience (beliefs & memories)
    + HSC is a single/temporary experience not cohering with the rest of your life - why accept it ?
        + and reject the everyday experience
        + demands transformation
        + does not provide any new intelligible content
        + ineffable, trans-rational
+ the **problem of ontonormativity** of HSC is at the heart of the axial revolution
    + still informing our cognitive grammar and existential ways of being
+ peoples' life get better after certain HSC

#### Need explanations to the problem of the ontonormativity of HSC

1. descriptive account
    + underlying cognitive processes
    + why it feels more real
    + why motivates transformative experience
    + cogsci approach: good mutual account oon all levels:
        a. cognitive processes (psychology)
        b. information processing processes (IT, ML, AI)
        c. brain processes (neuroscience)
2. prescriptive account
    + are HSC legitimate/philosophically justifiable ?
    + do they provide justification and guide for transformations
    + must cohere with the descriptive account
    + prove how a-c. provide a justification

Next up: 

+ HSC's don't provide new/reliable/scientific knowledge
    + the point of cognition/rationality is not just getting better beliefs
    + the change is wisdom: seeing through illusion
    + content of HSC is not important
    + the change is not in the propositional knowledge but in your functioning
       + gaining skills, sensibilities, sensitivities of significance landscaping that transform your existential mode
    + eg. the Buddha refused to answer metaphysical questions about nirvana/enlightenment
    + not getting knowledge, but getting wisdom and transformation
+ the Buddha integrated the problem of HSC to deal with our deepest problems:

> We as entities have to realize relevance, pursue salience, deal with existential anxiety, cultivate significance and meaning, try to overcome illusions and delusion, and find a fullness of being and an optimal grip on the world.
