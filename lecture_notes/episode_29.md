# Episode 29 - Getting to the Depths of Relevance Realization

## Centrality of RR - arguments converging (later diverging to explain)
+ problem solving; comb explosion of search space --> problem reframing to avoid it: zero in on relevant info
    + problem solving is the best way of understanding what we mean by intelligence (capacity of being a general problem solver)
    + ill-defined problems --> problem re-formulation: what's the relevant info
+ categorization:
    + judgements of similarity: logical (infinite features) vs psychological (compare relevant features/aspects)
+ communication: convey more than we say (conversational implicature) --> maxim of relevance
+ robot as a cognitive agent: proliferation/comb explosion of side effects --> zoom in on relevant side effects
+ consciousness: RR, especially in complex, ill-defined situations
+ working memory: relevance filter
+ connection between working memory and intelligence
+ --> RR is constitutive of intelligence, cognitive agency, consciousness
+ --> RR could explain aspects of lost meaning (3 orders: coherence, significance, purpose), sense of connectedness:
    + connections between: meaning - relevance - agency
    
Future:
Diverging: using the notion of RR to explain features that we consider central to human spirituality, self-transcendence, meaning making, wisdom

## Naturalistic/scientific explanation of Relevance

### Guiding methodological principle:
+ avoid circular argument, homoncular fallacy (vision explaining vision)
+ don't presuppose relevance
+ e.g. explain intelligence by processes that are not intelligent

if relevance is central to meaning, we could learn lessons wrt meaning, spirituality, consciousness by studying relevance

Theory of Representations (semantic level - how terms refer to objects in the world)
+ how we use representations in the mind
+ representation : sth that refers to an object in the world
+ representations are aspectual
     + nr of true properties is comb explosive
     + when forming a representation not all true properties are grasped
     + picking a relevant subset
+ --> aspectuality pre-supposes relevance --> representations are inherently aspectual
+ representations cannot be the causal origin (ontological basis) of relevance
    + but they can feed back to it, alter it
+ RR is not at the level of representational cognition (ideas, propositions, pictures)

#### experiment of multiple object tracking, moving red X
    + more objects you track, less features you can attribute to them
    + tracking hereness and nowness, everything else is lost; FINSTing (fingers of instantiation)
    + just tracking here-nowness: salience tagging of hereness and nowness
    + using demonstrative reference (pronouns): this, that
    + enactive demonstrative reference (not linguistic, eg. cat) <-- needed for mental grouping, categorization
    + categorization depends on enactive demonstrative reference
    
+ concept/category depends on pre/sub conceptual/categorical
+ enactive demonstrative reference: connectedness, mind being in contact/touch with reality/world
+ we need to pursue sub-categorical/semantical
+ higher states of consciousness: not conceptual/categorical, here-now, present
     + (but difficult for us because we identify with concepts, pictures in our head)

## Theory of Computations (syntactic level - how terms are coordinated within a syntax)
+ Hobbes: cognition is computation
+ Fodor (Computational Theory of the Mind) criticism:
    + implication != inference (https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implication_and_inference)
    + implication: logical relationship based on syntactic rules; relationship between propositions
        + "Have you stopped beating your wife?" suggests not only that you have a wife, but that you have been in the habit of beating her.
        + inference: using an implication relation to change your beliefs (recognize an implication)
             + beliefs have content
             + what beliefs should we change ? --> comb explosion
             + nr of implications between propositions is comb explosive
             + --> you can't be comprehensively, completely logical
             + decide which of the implications to select/commit to
                  + resources of attention/memory/time/metabolic energy are limited
                  + selecting/choosing implications that are relevant to the context
                       + they affect the beliefs you've already done RR on
             + inference presupposes RR
             
+ rules:
    + propositions telling you where to commit your resources
    + require interpretation / specification in application
        + eg. moral rule of "be kind"
        + use inferences in situ to derive actions and changes in beliefs
        + be kind to a child != be kind to a partner != be kind to a friend != be kind to a stranger
    + always conveys much more than it can say
    + cannot specify all applications --> comb explosion
    + --> master/higher order rule <-- same problem
    + Wittgenstein: no explanation of how to follow rules just in terms of rules
    + ability of follow rules: skill of judgement, knowing how --> out of the scope of the computational level
+ dependency between the 4 kinds of knowing      
    1. propositional depends on
    2. procedural: skill of what fits: skill of RR; depends on
    3. perspectival: situational awareness, salience landscaping: foreground-background (what's relevant as it is changing), formulate the problem well; depends on
    4. participatory: how agent and arena fit together and generate affordances of action/intelligibility
+ --> not causal, they interact
+ RR involves connecting the 4 kinds of knowing

## Theory of Modularity
+ central executive: making the decisions, responsible for RR
+ --> homoncular fallacy
+ problem with pointing to a place:
    + moving between feature and gestalt happens in multiple places/levels of cognition (attentional scaling)

## What we need for the Theory of RR:
+ internal goals:
     + goals internal to the brain, emerging developmentally from it
     + if a goal is representing/referring to the outer world --> not a place for the explanation of relevance
+ constitutive goals:
     + help constitute an system/process for being what it is
     + autopoietic systems (life, self-organizing system) to preserve/protect/promote themselves --> RR is central
+ scale invariant: multiple levels (feature-gestalt), self-correction, insigth
+ self-organizing

#### Theory of Relevance != Theory of RR
+ Scientific Theory of Relevance: not possible
+ Theory of RR: possible
