# Episode 22 - Descartes vs. Hobbes

2 grammars opposing each other:

+ Luther: *consci*ence
+ Descartes: *consci*ousness
+ intersect: individual mind

## Descartes (D) vs Hobbes (H) - Part II

Letter exchanges on reasoning, rationality:

#### Hobbes I

+ let's build a material machine for computation
    + that is all what **cognition** is
    + (no soul, no specialness/uniqueness)

#### Descartes I

+ rejecting materialism
+ claims of the scientific revolution:
    + matter is real
    + reality is mathematically measured
    + *meaning* and value of things is not in themselves
        + it is *normative*: **what is ought**
+ reasoning vs computation
    + goal/care/standard of reasoning: truth (acting on purpose)
+ *truth* depends on *meaning*      
+ **rationality** is Cartesian
    + rationality in human **reasoning**:
        + it is difficult to integrate rationality with scientific materialism
        + behaving *logically* to get **certainty** in our truths
        + criticism of rationality by Descartes himself
+ normativity, meaning, purpose are central to reasoning
+ matter is inert, has no purpose, no meaning
    + cannot have a material reasoner
+ science deals with how things *are*, not what *ought*
    + no normative structures
    + cannot get purpose and meaning out of matter:
        + eg. abacus, putting a sentence together: `cat on the mat`
+ no intrinsic meaning in material marks
    + they only have meaning because they are associated with ideas in your mind;
    + ideas possess meaning;
    + H's view on matter makes rationality problematic
+ rationality is not just the *logical manipulation* of propositions
    + rationality cares about meaning and normative standards

## Descartes vs Hobbes - Part II

#### Descartes II

+ Galileo: math is the language of reality (Plato)
    + __primary properties__: measurable qualities
        + only exist in objects
        + **objective**: *matter*
    + __secondary qualities__: **qualia**, pain, beauty
        + only exist in the mind
        + **subjective**: *mind*
+ *qualia* are central to consciousness
+ matter does not possess qualia
    + there is no way to generate qualia or consciousness from matter
+ AI does not possess consciousness
+ the **mind** is **isolated**, trapped inside itself
    + doubt of everything
+ __certainty__:
    1. logical notion: deductive validity
    2. psychological notion: inability of doubt (eg. radical bigot)
+ D pushes 2. to the extreme, even doubting math
    + cannot doubt that he exists: in order to be subject to illusion, his **mind must exists**
        + "cogito ergo sum" (statement not argument)
        + makes `1. == 2.`
+ mind is only consciousness (mind touching itself), nothing else
    + I know I am conscious by being conscious
    + matter does not have that

#### AI

+ __weak__: important, but does not advance our scientific understanding
+ __strong__: AGI:
    + computer as an instance of mind, consciousness
+ how do we know if it succeeded ? 
    + open question
    + but: we can refute D's objections (purpose, meaning consciousness, normativity, contact with realness)

## Criticism of Descartes

+ problem with Descartes' solution: its **existential cost**
+ **mind** and **matter** are different, they share no properties
    + mind: purpose, truth, qualia, contact with itself
    + matter: space and time, force, energy transfer
+ but: **mind and matter causally interact**
    + mind making matter change and vice versa
    + mind and matter are constantly interacting
    + D's solution makes the mind-matter/mind interaction impossible
    + you are being cut off from yourself
        + taste of water is absurd
    + mind-mind interaction is impossible
        + i.e. paying attention to another body
        + _**how do I know other minds are not automaton ?**_

### Dichotomy of Realness: An Unstable Grammar

+ back and forth, ad-hominem arguments (insults) 
+ **empiricism**
    + math is real
+ **positivism**:
    + _**how do you know you are not dreaming ?**_
+ mind touching itself
    + *consciousness* is *real*: rationality
+ **Romanticism**
    + how can you be in touch with the word ?
    + loss of contact with
        + tradition
        + body
        + other minds
        + world
    + do I still have contact with my own mind ?
        + historical notions of *self* are false
        + introspections/memories are false
+ logical consequence:
    + only contact is: this moment of contactless, isolated self-awareness
    + meaning crisis

## Pascal (P) vs Descartes (D)

+ P has a transformative experience (religious)
+ spirit of geometry/math - we have this, Descartes
+ spirit of **finesse** - we lost it (jazz, kissing, tai chi)
    + __procedural__: knowing how
    + __perspectival__: knowing what it's like
    + __participatory__: knowing mutual transformation, reciprocal revelation
+ we lost the possibility of transformative truth/knowing
+ we don't believe in self-transcendence (since Luther)
    + we don't need self-transformation to be in contact with reality
    + only math/computation

> As a result, We face environmental, economic, socio-political crises and culture wars.
