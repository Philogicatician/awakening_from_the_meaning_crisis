# Episode 19 - Augustine and Aquinas

## Augustine (4th century)

+ influences: Christianity > Neoplatonism > Gnosticism
+ dark era, evil powers
+ personal loss of agency
+ salient evil powers 
    + leading to personal suffering
+ Augustine is a sex addict: "licking the open sore of lust"
    + leads him to self-loathing
+ dark side of us:
    + stealing a fruit just because it is the wrong thing to do (traumatic event)
+ dark side is dragging us down: desire, anger, destruction - why, why, why ?

### Transformative Experiences

+ reads __Plotinus__ which helps him,
    + but: has a rebound after mystical experience
        + darkness pulls back
+ reads __Paul__:
    + **inner conflict**: new worldview that makes sense of it

### Love and Reason

+ two **loves** that drive us:
     1. becoming one within
     2. becoming one with what's real, true, good, beautiful
+ at the heart of reason is love
    + we lost love not reason
+ __how to heal__:
    + Christian answer: grow/participate in love/agape
        + one becomes a fully realized person

#### Confessions

+ an existential guide
+ Neoplatonism needs Christianity (Gnosis)
+ synthesises Neoplatonism, Gnosticism and Christianity

## Plotinus

+ how to move up the levels of reality/consciousness;i
    + gaining oneness,
    + becoming more real

### Three Dimensions of Meaning in Life (CogSci)

#### Coherence

+ sense of **coherence**:
    + intelligibility, making sense

#### Significance

+ sense of **significance**:
    + how good/deep/real are the elements of your life

#### Purpose

+ sense of **purpose**:
    + direction of your life

### Orders

#### Nomological Order

+ (Plotinus -- Aristotle):
    + conformity theory, how things are structured, geocentric worldview - coherence
+ connects us to what's real cognitively

#### Normative Order

+ (Plotinus -- Plato):
    + moving up the levels of reality, becoming better - significance
- up: increased awareness, self, oneness
- down: destroying, losing structure, disorder, fragmenting, less understanding, chaos, losing truth, evil
* Plotinus: knowing what's real --> becoming more real through love
* inner peace and contact with reality
* connects us existentially: what's good, how to become better
* Platonic spirituality

#### Narrative Order

+ move from evil to goodness - purpose
* how to become better
* try and afford realization --> becoming more real
* agape
* moving towards to promise land, forward through history, both individually and collectively
* Christian process of moving through history


1)-2)-3) are interrelated: synthesis of scientific, spiritual, therapeutic/emotional, existential --> lasts 1000 years integrated with
    - the most profound spirituality, no antagonism, no irrationality in it
    - with a personal project of therapy of therapeutic change and healing
    - sappy essential education, the cultivation of genuine wisdom
    - true self and self transcendence
    - in community with yourself, your world, your culture, and other people]

## Post-Augustine History

+ 1054: __the great schism__
    + East: Plato, Neoplatonism, mystical theology
    + West: Aristotle

### Changing Psychotechnologies: Reading

#### Before

+ reading aloud, recital in communityi
    + *Lectio Divina*: the text speaks to you, transforms you,
        + remembering the being mode
+ thought is conforming to the world (gnosis, anagoge)
+ **extensive self**: connected to the world

#### After

+ reading in silence, alone
+ losing the *participatory* aspect to the *propositional*:
    + looking for **coherence** (logical) in language
        + coherent propositional language: the way to know things
+ thought is to have coherent set of propositions in your head
    + **having mode**
+ **intensive self**: inside my head
   + losing reading as a psychotechnology of psycho-spiritual-existential-transformation
       + rediscovering Aristotle:
           + new explanatory power, that is not in the Bible
            + scientific opening, reorientation toward the external world
                + leads to crisis in the Christian world

## Thomas Aquinas

+ solves:
    1. assimilating Aristotle: new way of looking at the world
    2. saving Christian worldview

### Axial Worldview

+ *two worlds* (Plato --> Aristotle):
    1. __real world__; natural world - down
        + can be studied by reason and science
    2. __illusory world__; supernatural world  - up

### Separation

Of:
+ will and love
+ the two worlds
+ Aquinas tries to make the illusory world real
    + knowledge that we cannot study by reason and science
    + only by faith
+ separating the *two worlds*:
    + *love* and *reason* pulled apart,
        + love does not move reason anymore, love does not move reason up

#### Augustine

+ __will moves love__
+ **faith**: participation in the flow

#### Aquinas

+ __love moves the will__
    + to assert things it cannot know through reason
+ **faith**: *willful assertion*
    + **assertion** of statements, propositions
    + *will* driven by the *love of God*
+ separation of:
    + love and reason
        + as times goes, will becomes less and less driven by love, but by willpower alone
    + spirituality and science
        + the supernatural world is no longer viable/livable to us
+ axial wisdom falls apart: change in the nomological order: separation of reason and love
