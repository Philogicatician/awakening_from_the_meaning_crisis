# Episode 39 -  The Religion of No Religion

## Recap

+ proposal to address PPs
    + systematic set of practices/psychotechs
    + but: historical forces undermine practices/meaning in life
    + agape for the rescue 
+ proposal to address historical forces
    + insights afforded by the Valera/4E CogSci article
    + creating a worldview that situates meaning making 
    + recovering the 3 orders:
        + nomological:
        + normative:
        + post-narrative: open-ended optimization
            + transcendence into (rather than above or beyond)
+ todo's:
    + cogsci account of wisdom: wisdom framing
    + Religion That's Not a Religion (RTNAR)

## Religion That's Not a Religion (RTNAR)

Many people are working on this:

+ eg. J. Carse: The Religious Case Against Belief

__Motivation__:

+ cultivating an ability for awe and wonder that is consonant with the scientific worldview
+ returning to religion is not a viable option (history)
+ pursuing pseudo-religious political/utopian ideologies is also not viable (history/trauma)
+ but we need a set of psychotechs/practices that allow the transformation of consciousness/cognition/character/culture
    + to address the meta-crisis (Thomas BjÃ¶rkman)
+ role of religio:
    + indispensable mythos
        + activation/accentuation/appreciation/acceleration of religio

### Religio vs Credo

+ **credo**: 'I believe'; stating the truth content that has to be believed
    + *propositional* knowing ascending
    + *having mode* ascending
    + the having of propositions
    + willful assertion: not derived from reason
    + religions as belief systems
+ credo has an important role

#### Credo Dominance vs Functionality of Credo

__Credo Dominance__:

+ postmodern critique:
    + power, dominance creating purity codes
        + boundaries between *us* and *them*

__Functionality__:

+ mythos is indispensable for individuals/groups:
    + to get sacredness out of religio
    + contextual sensitivity
    + dynamic coupling of religio
+ but:
    + indispensability != metaphysical  necessity
    + need != authority
+ but but:
    + the *functionality* of credo is indispensable

#### Indispensable Functionality of Credo

__Signal Detection Theory__


+ facing PPs while doing information processing
    + information is always overwhelming (too much) and partial (inadequate)
    + information is ambiguous
+ signal vs noise
    + **signal**: info I want
    + **noise**: info I do not want (distracting/misleading)
    + signal and noise are overlapping normal distributions
        + important to distinguish signal from noise
    + eg. sound in the bush for the gazelle
        + leopard (--> signal)
        + rustling of the leaves caused by the wind (not relevant --> noise)
    + being signal and noise is the matter of RR
    + there is an overlap between signal and noise
        + what to do to decide what it is
    + getting more/new info has diminishing returns
        + new info will also suffer from the signal-noise overlap problem
        + time of taking new info is also an important constraint
        + cannot escape the signal-noise overlap problem; cannot have full certainty;
            + putting in too much time to reduce it also becomes too costly
+ every act is a gamble (even an act of perception)
+ trade-off between contingencies (false positives (FP) vs false negatives (FN))
    + criterion of where to draw the line between signal and noise
+ two types of errors:
    1. criterion too high: treating a lot of noise as signal (type I error, too many FPs)
        + mistake noise for signal
    2. criterion too low: exclude all noise from signal (type II error, too many FNs)
        + missing signal
+ the importance of different kinds of errors depends on the context
    + sometimes *miss* is more costly than *mistake* (eg. gazelles)
    + sometimes *mistake* is more costly than *miss* (eg. ...)
+ setting the criterion has to be context flexible
    + perspectival knowing (situational awareness) is crucial
    + Lau: one of the functions of consciousness is to set the criterion for perception
        + what you are paying attention to
    + Vervaeke (converging argument): one of the functions of consciousness is to do RR within perspectival knowing

__Credo is setting the criterion on religio.__

+ what behaviors put me into contact with religio
+ what is malfunctioning

__Setting the criterion is inescapable.__

+ absolute/final way: credo dominance
    + the open-endedness of RR undermines this attempt
    + see history of the Inquisition in the West
        + trained the West for totalitarian regimes
+ with mythos: gnosis
    + continually resetting the criterion optimally
+ RTNAR would always have *credo* in the service of *religio*
    + sacredness being grounded in an open-ended optimization

### RTNAR Crafting Mythos

+ RTNAR should always have *credo* in the service of *religio*

#### 1. Unconscious Level

+ most RR is taking place here
    + no introspective aspect to RR
+ grounding of **participatory knowing**
    + the autobiographical ego and world as an arena emerge from this subconscious level
+ connections are being made

#### 2. Conscious Level

+ salience landscaping (SL)
+ level of **perspectival knowing** (grounded in participatory)
    + makes **procedural knowing** possible
    + my coping-caring becomes skillful interaction
+ connections are being sensed/internalized

#### 3. Cultural Level

+ distributed cognition
+ machinery of science
+ communication happens here
+ connections are being shared
+ machinery of *mythos*:
    1. **propositional knowing**
        + credo in the service of religio
    2. mythos is always projecting downwards to the procedural/perspectival/participatory knowing
+ mythos should always serve both the above

#### RTNAR and Psychotechs

__Structural Features__:

+ RTNAR should cultivate an ecology of psychotechs
    + top down: propositional --> ... --> participatory
    + bottom up: participatory --> ... --> propositional
+ complementary practices/cognitive styles
    + corresponding checks and balances
    + corresponding strengths and weaknesses
+ a reliable and self-correcting dynamical system
+ meta-psychotech to coordinate the intuitive psychotechs
    + addressing PPs
    + coherent with worldview attunement
    + collective level
    + engineering individual psychotechs
+ meta-virtue: *wisdom*
    + coordinating and cultivating individual virtues
    + individual level
    + need it for the cultivation of meta-psychotech

__Organizational Features__:

+ open-ended credo:
+ eg. cyber-technologies: creating wikis
    + collective/cooperative
    + stability & evolution
+ *credo-wiki* could emerge:
    + stable: shared curriculum for communities
    + dynamic: re-engineering the creation of the meta-psychtech

## 3 Responses to the Meaning Crisis

1. set of psychotechs/practices to address PPs
2. setting PPs into a legtimating worldview via 4E cogsci
3. RTNAR

## Cultivation of Wisdom

+ meta-virtue needed for
    + communitas, cultivation of the meta-psychotechs
    + project of enlightenment
    + satisfying the deep connectedness to the:
        + self
        + world
        + others

### CogSci of Wisdom

#### Stenberg Ontology, 1990

#### McKee and Barber, 1999

+ linking
    1. philosophical theories of wisdom
        + theoretical, top down
    2. psychological theories
        + empirically driven
+ finding a convergent themes in 1. and 2.
    + core ability of wisdom:

> Systematically seeing through illusion and into reality.

+ profound and systematic insight
    + eg. in HSC
