Axial Age | split of everyday and real worlds | knowing how to make the transformative leap | connectedness to the real world | how you can self-transform, grow | direction, purpose, narrative | beyond time and space, ongoing creation

### Foreshadow of the Meaning Crisis

+ more fluency in info processing makes the info more real (regardless of the content)

+ increasing cognitive fluency gets an enhanced sense of being in touch with things/reality
+ lot of fluency --> flow state

#### Alphabet

+ adding vowels
    + make processing "easier"
    + improve fluency of alphabetic literacy
+ standardized left to right reading
    + standard improve fluency of processing

#### City States

+ Athens: emergency of "democracy"
+ argumentation and debate become more important

#### Enhanced/sped up axial revolution of cognition
