# Episode 09 - Insight

## Recap

+ Siddharta's self-denial is still within the realms of the self, this the having mode
+ Siddharta' commitment to the middle path through mindfulness
+ mindfulness revolution
     + mindfulness can address the personal meaning crises
     + but maybe part of the response for the meaning crisis in the West
+ what is mindfulness ?
    + sati: remembering the being mode (knowing by being)
    + leads to self-transformation, alleviates existential anxiety and distress
    + feature list is not sufficient to explain, need idos/structural functional organization too
        + causal and constitutive relationships between features

state | trait
--- | ---
being present | insight
not judging | reduced reactivity, increased equanimity

+ being present --> right concentration:
    + soft vigilance: con-forming, being interested in sth continuously
+ <-- paying attention

## The Model of Attention

+ getting the right tuning: not too tight, not too loose
+ spotlight metaphor: altering salience
    + not sufficient
+ attention is not a direct action (eg. walking), but modifying/optimizing sth else
     + optimizing seeing into looking
     + optimizing hearing into listening
     + optimizing your looking and listening to listen to someone
+ question: how this optimization is linked to existential, modal confusion
    + how to alleviate that suffering
+ question: how can mindfulness train attention to cause more insight
    + cause a systematic set of insights (wisdom) that are mutually related to the transformation of existential mode
+ cognitive unison: multiple cognitive processes that share the same goal / are coordinated
+ Polanyi: ...
 
### Experiment

+ tapping the cup with the pen/probe with the finger
+ awareness moving from the cup to the probe, to the finger, then back to the probe, to the cup
+ eg. glasses:
    + when framing/subsidiary - transparent; looking through them
    + when focal - opaque; looking at them
    + transparency to opacity shift

### Attention Flowing (Transparency-Opacity: T-O)

+ awareness types
    + subsidiary/implicit awareness (probe); aware through it - opaque
    + focal/explicit awareness (cup); aware of it - transparent
    + attention through subsidiary awareness into focal awareness
+ transparency-opacity (T-O) shift
    + stepping back, dropping back:
        + looking through my feelings through my fingers through my probe into the cup
        + probe becomes focal and opaque
            + finger becomes subsidiary and transparent
        + finger becomes focal and opaque
            + sensations become subsidiary and transparent
        + sensations/feelings become focal and opaque
            + awareness becomes subsidiary and transparent
        + awareness/consciousness becomes focal and opaque
            + seer becomes subsidiary and transparent
            + (turning attention upon itself)
+ opacity-transparency (O-T) shift
        + sensations become subsidiary and transparent
            + finger becomes focal and opaque
        + fingers become subsidiary and transparent
            + probe becomes focal and opaque
        + probe becomes subsidiary and transparent
            + cup becomes focal and opaque
+ recursive, dynamic structuring
    + attention is doing T-O and O-T shifts at the same time
    + multiple processes integrated together to optimize and prioritize an object or situation
+ visual metaphor for how attention operates (via body orientation)
     + flowing in and out
+ participatory knowing:
     + knowing th cup through the probe
     + indwelling the probe:
         + not knowing the probe,but knowing through it
         + integrated with it
+ technology eg. my vision is integrated with my glasses (looking through the glasses)
+ psychotechnology eg. my cognition is integrated with my literacy (looking through literacy)

> You can look through a lot of processing deeply out into the world, or you can step back, and look at a lot of processing and withdraw towards the center of your mind.

### Attention Flowing (Gestalt-Feature: G-F)

#### Experiment I

+ `tHe cHt`
    + `H` or `A`
+ the pseudo Zen problem of reading:
    + in order to read the the words you have to read each letters
    + in order to disambiguate each letter you must have read the words
    + therefore reading is impossible
+ reading is not impossible:
    + letters are **feature**s
    + word is the **gestalt**/structure/idos
+ nothing is inherently a feature (letter-word-sentence)
+ attention is simultaneously going up from the features to the gestalt; and down from the gestalt to the features

#### Experiment II - 9-dot problem

+ misframing things:
    + automatically project the square
    + automatically take as a connect-the-dot problem: no non-dot turns are possible
+ solution:
    + break up frame
    + de-automatize cognition: do not treat it categorically (as a connect-the-dot problem)
+ bring stuff happening unconsciously into consciousness
    + T-O shift
    + is therapy a set of T-O shifts (?)
        + and also re-structuring the personality
            + eg. punitive parent and abused child modes shrink; healthy adult and happy child grow
        + long dynamic, reinforcing process

### Attention Schema & Mindfulness Practices

+ attention is constantly doing
    + T-O (out-in) shifting
    + G-F shifting (up-down)

G-F/O-T | Opacity | Transparency
--- | --- | ---
Gestalt | - | Contemplation/Scaling Down/At-Onement
Feature | Meditation/Scaling Down/PCE | -

+ attention scaling/training
+ mindfulness is making use of the complex dynamical/self-organizing processing of attention
+ optimizing these processes (O-T-O-T-...,  G-F-G-F-...)

#### Meditation

+ word meaning: moving towards the center
+ training:
    + pay attention to the feelings around the breath in the abdomen
    + (normally we pay attention through our feelings/sensations to an object/world)
    + meditation:
         + stepping back and looking at the sensations
         + breaking the gestalt
+ scaling down of attention
    + stepping back; layers: probe --> finger --> feeling/sensation --> seer --> consciousness --> PCE
+ direction:
    + from transparency to opacity
    + from gestalt to feature
    + mind is less representational, less inferential
    + withdraw toward the center of your mind; looking at your mind, looking at the lens of your mind
+ positive: break up a bad pattern, see the features, de-automatize cognition, chunk decomposition, constraint relaxation
    + make unconscious processes conscious
+ negative: choking
    + opacity: observing what you are looking through (glasses, fingers, sensations, feelings, literacy), and iterate; looking at
+ **chunk decomposition**
+ **constraint relaxation**
    + de-automatizing cognition
+ mystical experience: PCE: pure consciousness event
    + looking at the mind (in) - mind wander (out) - re-center (in) - many times
    + looking at the mind; step back and look at the more subsidiary/deeper layers of the mind; ...; step back and look at consciousness; step back and be just conscious: PCE
    + not conscious of anything
    + not looking through the self-machinery/mind/consciousness
+ breath out: PCE/vipassana
+ mind is less representational, less inferential
+ question: why would meditation cause insight ?
    + a system of psychotechs is optimizing cognition to cause insight
    + meditation alone does not

#### Contemplation

+ word etymology:
    + con + temple (lat.: sky, look up towards the divine)
    + temple <-- theoria (gr. see more deeply into reality)
+ scaling up of attention
    + scaling up with you sense of identity
+ from opacity to transparency (O-T)
+ from feature to gestalt (F-G )
+ positive: develop a better frame, gestalt; look more deeply into the world, re-focus
+ negative: locked in a bad frame, fixation
+ transparency: i.e. looking through the glasses, sensations
+ --> participating in the world
+ eg. metta, lectio divina, chanting
+ transparency of psychotechs (eg. literacy, numeracy, second order thinking) in our cognition
    + integrated them into cognition
+ mystical experience: super flow state, inter-connectedness, resonant at-onement (one-ness)
+ breath in: super-flow, resonant at-onement

#### Moving Practices

+ flowing between in and out, scaling up and scaling down
+ tai chi chuan
    + flowing between in and out

#### Prajna/Non-Duality

+ opponent processing between T-O and G-F (pull-push)
    + forced to coordinate
    + get the right degree of attentional engagement that is the most dynamically fitted to the world
+ non-duality/prajna/wisdom: oscillate/flow between T-O and G-F
+ training: cycle of the breath:
    + breath in: super-flow, resonant at-onement
    + breath out: PCE/vipassana
+ mystical experience: (transcends) both PCE and at-onement; prajna/non-duality
    + leads to a comprehensive capacity for insight
    + insight about the grammar of the agent-arena relationship
        + pushing to the ground of the agent
        + pushing out to circumference of the arena
        + see the connectedness between the two
    + insight into the existential modes of being
    + sati: remembering the being mode, awakening
+ Buddha: "I am awake."
    + moving from an identity to a fundamental mode of being
    + have a systematic set of insight

## Insight

+ flowing between both opposites (in/out, up/down; T-O, G-F)
+ fluctuating between both kinds of attentional engagement
+ constantly adjusted attentional fittedness to the world
+ flexibility of attentional scaling
+ optimizing attention and thus cognition
+ how mindfulness can train attention that causes gaining more insight
    + scaling down/meditation: mind is less representational, less inferential
        + gain more mastery over / being more aware of the processes of problem framing

### Altered/Higher States of Consciousness (HSC) & Mystical Experiences

+ 30-40% of the population experienced them (universal across cultures)
    + increase sense of meaning
    + most significant experience in life
+ why are they different from other altered states (dream, being drunk)
+ why do we pursue them ?
    + mindfulness/psychedelic revolution
+ why do they bring about powerful transformations ?
+ why does it feel more real than this world ?
    + reject this world (axial, eg. Plato's cave)
    + most of the world's axial religions predicate on the idea of HCE's that bring about radical modal transformation ("quantum change")
+ connection between frequency of flow/HCE'S ~ meaningfulness of life
    + connection between awakening & recovering meaning
    + connection between awakening & insight
+ capacity for insight/making sense/coherence increases
    + content does not matter - ineffable
    + improved optimization for making sense inwardly/outwardly
    + improved optimization of anagoge
+ the nature of mindfulness enhances the ability to enter into HCE's
    + alleviate existential distress
    + optimize insight
    + increase capacity of meaning in life
+ core of meaning/wisdom:
    + create a systematic set of insights -->
    + transformation of agent and arena --> recover the being mode

Next up:

+ what is consciousness
+ what are transformative experiences ?
+ what are HCE's
+ what kind of knowing is this (not of words) ?
