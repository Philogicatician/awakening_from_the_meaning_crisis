# Episode 36 - Religio/Perennial Problems/Reverse Eng. Enlightenment

## Recap

+ experience of sacredness
+ symbols:
    + what role symbols have in understanding sacredness
    + symbols are a participatory act
        + activating a metaphor & reaching back through the exaptation
process by holding sth in mind:
            + re-experience some aspect of reality
    + setting up an anagogic process:
            + I'm transformed through the symbol into reality
            + reality can speak through the symbol to me
            + mutual/reciprocal realization: feels like love, coupling to reality in a profound way
    + symbols set the trajectory of transframing reality & growing the
self in the new world
    + symbols are ecstatic, participatory, integrative, complex
    + we can understand symbols as *mythos*
        + mythos: symbol & story (--> ritual)
+ mythos:
    + we can use mythos to activate *religio*
        + religio is inherently valuable to us because it is primordial
            + RR is at the heart of religio: RR functions by being
interested in (correcting/developing) itself
            + this is why we love the *flow state*
    + the act of serious play with an intrinsically valuable machinery
+ sacredness
    + higher order RR
    + using the symbol to play with the meta-assimilation/accommodation
+ the sacred:
    + __metaphysical proposal__: the source/cause of *sacredness* is *the sacred*
        + not found in all accounts of sacredness: the dao, sunyata
            + "vast emptiness"
            + no supernatural source of righteousness
    + __alternative proposal__:
        + critique: *the sacred* is not an essence to *sacredness*
            + no thing is absolutely/inherently relevant to us
            + relevance does not have an essence
            + *the sacred* is a category mistake
            + RR is not about detecting/finding sth inherently relevant
                + RR functions by evolving
                + RR evolves by functioning
        + the idea of sacredness:
            + the *inexhaustibleness* of reality
            + this reality is always a source of wonder:
                + every object/thing is comb. explosive (*vast emptiness*)
                + *no-thingness*: as everything is comb explosive

## Vast emptiness / no-thingness

+ comb explosive nature of reality
+ cognitive processing/RR is also comb explosive:
    + the *I* that is never reducible
    + the *framing* that cannot be captured in the *frame*
+ RR is inexhaustible, it cannot stop
+ *inexhaustible no-thingness* of me & *inexhausible no-thingness* of reality
    + vast emptiness: "the dao that can be spoken is not the dao"
+ the real potential of sacredness is always in the world

#### Indispensableness

Why people still think there is the sacred ?

+ some symbols/mythos are indispensable for
individuals/groups/traditions to activate religio
    + because of the way RR has been evolving in them:
        + kairos/timing
+ __indispensability != metaphysical necessity__
    + eg. one's native language is indispensable for them, but their
particular language is not a metaphysical necessity for communication
       + not a final/complete/absolute form
       + didn't exist, and won't exist
+ __the sacred != the supernatural__
    + *the sacred* is the inexhaustible source of PPPP intelligibility
    + *the supernatural* is linked to metaphysical necessity
+ eg. the shark being the way the shark is, is indispensable to the
shark's capacity for survival
    + but the shark's form is not the final/finished/absolute form of fittedness
    + --> life's capacity for fittedness is inexhaustible
+ the *two-world mythology* is not necessary for accessing
*sacredness*, deep connectedness of religio
+ the machinery of connectedness can be disconnected from:
    + *metaphysical essentialism*
    + the supernatural
+ the machinery of connectedness have to integrated with science:
        + grounded in the naturalistic explanation of RR
        + re-situates us back into the scientific worldview (!)
        + --> 1st step in resolving the meaning crisis

## Naturalistic Explanation of RR an Its Answers

### Meaning Crisis

#### Historical Analysis

+ historical factors: losing the worldview of deep connectedness/sacredness
+ the new worldview has to fit us back; give us the 3 orders
+ how the naturalistic explanation of RR can address historical issues ?

### Structural-Functional Analysis

+ the machinery of meaning making/RR == the machinery of meaninglessness
    + capable of adaptaion and **self-deception**
+ all cultures face/are prone to **perennial problems**:
    + when the machinery of RR drives you to
meaninglessness/self-deception/self-destruction

#### Perennial Problems (PPs)

+ undermine religio
+ cultures developed ecologies of practices/psychotechs to alleviate
the suffering of PP
    + pursuing wisdom
    + pursuing enlightenment/salvation
+ historical factors undermined the worldview/cognitive grammar of
these practices/psychotechs --> meaning crisis
+ 4E/3rd generational cogsci can give a response to these historical factors:
    + __RR__ for understanding __meaning making__
    + __religio__ for understanding __sacredness__
        + religion as a higher order form of RR
+ addressing PPs with RR/religio/sacredness

### Reverse Engineer Enlightenment

+ *meaning crisis*: MC

#### Intro to the Awakening Process

+ what practices/processes can we use to address the PPs
+ *enligthenment* definition:
    + set of practices that ameliorate PPs and alleviate the distress
they inflict on us
    + eg. cogsci explanation of HSC
+ (scientific/historical) theory is not enough to awaken from the meaning crisis
    + we need an understanding that affords/facilitates the
transformation we need to awaken

#### Getting the Process of Awakening from MC Started

+ at the perspectival/participatory level

> The very machinery that makes us adaptive, also makes us susceptible for self-deceptive/destructive behavior.

+ we cannot jump over our own shadows
    + things go *awry*

__Functional aspect__:

+ RR:
    + self-organizing
        + goes awry in *parasitic processing*
    + self-identification
        + goes awry in *modal confusion*
    + self-reflection
        + H. Frankfurt: *the wanton* acting completely impulsively --> losing agency as impulses are in conflict
             + need to step back and reflect: get coordination/integration
             + reflection/integration reduces *wantonnes*, eg.:
                 + when I'm thirsty, I see the world thirstily - one perspective
                 + transparency-opacity shift: being aware of my thirst; another perspective (curiosity)
                 + my motivational machinery becomes driven not only
by thirst, but by curiosity also
                 + gaining relief from compulsion/craving
        + moving up from impulsiveness/wantonnes to self-reflection
(re-gaining agency)
        + goes awry in *reflectiveness gap* (RG)
            + opening up self-reflection help re-gaining agency
            + but: maximizing self-reflection makes you incapable of
acting, chokes, getting disconnected from the motivational machinery
(Hamlet)
            + __question__: how to optimize between the
involvement/immersion of *the wanton* and self-correcting flexibility
of *Hamlet* ?
             + __answer__: RR optimization problem; trade-off between
exploiting/generalizing/*stepping through* and
exploring/specializing/*stepping back*

high | max self-reflection | losing agency | Hamlet
--- | --- | --- | ---
optimal | process | agency | ...
low | impulsiveness | losing agency | the wanton

__Structural aspect__:

+ meta-meaning in the agent-arena relationship
    + loss: domicide

1. absurdity --> horror
    + loss of connection between self and the world
    + __clash of perspectives__/worldviews
    + perspectival level
    + T. Nagel:
        + the absurd is *not* the result of our inferential processing
(propositional knowing)
            + arguments like `Nothing I do matters a million years
from now.`, `I'm too small.`, `I'm going to to die anyways.` are not
generating absurdity; they come *after* we've already experienced it
at the perspectival/participatory level
        + RR is below the propositional level
        + eg. *everyday absurdity*: Tom confessing love to Susan's voicemail
        + humor can overlap absurdity
        + raw clash of perspectives:
            + experience of incoherence, loss of connectedness
            + history undermined the axial meaning making perspective
2. anxiety
    + loss of connection within the self
    + inner conflict
3. alienation
     + loss of connection between self and other people

__Developmental aspect__:

+ existential inertia
    + trapped in a worldview
    + cannot activate anagoge
+ existential ignorance (indecisiveness)
    + don't know what you are going to *lose* if going through the
transformation
    + don't know what you are going to *miss* if going through the
transformation

Next up:

+ engineering a comprehensive response to the above perennial problems (PPs)
+ any development of procedural/perspectival/participatory knowing
that affords amelioration of PPs (--> enlightenment)
