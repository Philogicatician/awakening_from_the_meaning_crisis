# Episode 19 - Augustine and Aquinas

## Augustine (4th century)

+ influenced by:
    + Christianity
    + Neoplatonism
    + Gnosticism
+ religion: *Manichaeism*
    + gnostic components:
    + *light* has to be liberated from *dark* by gnosis
+ dark era, evil powers
+ personal loss of agency
+ salient evil powers 
+ leading to personal suffering
+ sex addiction:
    + "licking the open sore of lust"
    + leads him to self-loathing
+ there is a *dark side* of us:
    + stealing a fruit just because it is the wrong thing to do
    + (traumatic event)
+ dark side is dragging us down: desire, anger, destruction - why, why, why ?

### Transformative Experiences

+ reads __Plotinus__ which helps him,
    + but: has a *rebound effect* after mystical experience
        + darkness pulls back
+ reads __Paul__:
    + **inner conflict**:
    + new worldview that makes sense of inner conflict

### Love and Reason

+ two **loves** that drive us (Plotinus, Plato):
     1. becoming one within
     2. becoming one with what's real/true/good/beautiful
+ at the heart of *reason* is *love*
    + capacity for love has been lost, not reason
+ __how to heal__:
    + Christian answer: grow/participate in love/agape
    + there is a love *within* reason
        + that can help you grow beyond reason
            + to what reason always sought
        + one becomes a fully realized person
            + through growing in agape

#### Confessions

+ Augustine's autobiography
+ an existential guide
+ Neoplatonism needs Christianity/Gnosis
+ synthesises Neoplatonism, Gnosticism and Christianity

## Plotinus

+ how to move up the levels of reality/consciousness
    + gaining oneness
    + becoming more real

### Three Dimensions of Meaning in Life (CogSci)

#### Coherence

+ sense of **coherence**:
    + intelligibility, making sense

#### Significance

+ sense of **significance**:
    + how good/deep/real are the elements of your life

#### Purpose

+ sense of **purpose**:
    + direction of your life

### Orders

#### Nomological Order

+ (Plotinus, Aristotle):
    + conformity theory, how things are structured, geocentric worldview - *coherence*
+ connects us to what's real cognitively

#### Normative Order

+ (Plotinus, Plato):
    + moving up the levels of reality/self/consciousness
    + becoming better - *significance*
+ __two worlds__:
    + **up**:
        + increased awareness, self, oneness
    + **down**:
        + things have less sense/integration here
        + destroying, losing structure/idos, disorder, fragmenting, less understanding, chaos, evil
        + losing truth/goodness/beauty
        + losing intellegibility
+ knowing what's real
    + becoming more real through love
+ inner peace and contact with reality
+ connects us existentially: what's good, how to become better
+ Platonic spirituality

#### Narrative Order

+ Christianity puts the nomological and normative orders together
    + everything is moving from evil to goodness - *purpose*
+ how to become better
+ try and afford realization
    * becoming more real
+ moving towards to promise land, forward through history, both individually and collectively
+ Christian process of moving through history

The three orders are interrelated:

+ 3 axes of the space of meaning
+ synthesis of scientific, spiritual, therapeutic/emotional, existential
    + lasts 1000 years integrated with:
    - the most profound spirituality, no antagonism, no irrationality in it
    - with a personal project of therapy of therapeutic change and healing
    - sappy essential education, the cultivation of genuine wisdom
    - true self and self transcendence
    - in community with yourself, your world, your culture, and other people]
+ all of us can self-transcend this way

## Post-Augustine History

+ 1054: __the great schism__
    + East: Plato, Neoplatonism, mystical theology
        + Avicenna
    + West: Aristotle
        + Averros

### Changing Psychotechnologies: Reading

#### Before

+ reading aloud, recital in communityi
    + embodied/perspectival/participatory
    + *Lectio Divina*:
        + the text speaks to you, transforms you,
        + meditative/mindful receptivity
        + opening oneself to the text
        + remembering the being mode
+ __model of thought__:
    + thought is conforming to the world
        + (gnosis, anagoge)
        + self-transformation
        + model of knowing is also
            + the way of being/becoming
+ **extensive self**: connected to the world

#### After

+ reading in silence, alone
+ losing the *participatory* aspect to the *propositional*:
    + looking for **coherence** (logical) in language
        + coherent propositional language: the way to know things
+ __model of thought__:
    + thought is to have coherent set of propositions in your head
        + **having mode**
+ **intensive self**: inside my head
   + losing reading as a psychotechnology of psycho-spiritual-existential-transformation
       + rediscovering Aristotle:
           + new explanatory power, that is not in the Bible
            + scientific opening, reorientation toward the external world
                + leads to crisis in the Christian world

## Thomas Aquinas

+ solves:
    1. assimilating Aristotle: new way of looking at the world
    2. saving Christian worldview

### Axial Worldview

+ *two worlds* (Plato, Aristotle):
    1. __real world__; natural world - down
        + can be studied by reason and science
    2. __illusory world__; supernatural world  - up

### Separation

Of:
+ will and love
+ the two worlds
+ Aquinas tries to make the illusory world real
    + knowledge that we cannot study by reason and science
    + only by faith
+ separating the *two worlds*:
    + *love* and *reason* pulled apart,
        + love does not move reason anymore, love does not move reason up

#### Augustine

+ __will moves love__
+ **faith**: participation in the flow

#### Aquinas

+ __love moves the will__
    + to assert things it cannot know through reason
+ **faith**: *willful assertion*
    + **assertion** of statements, propositions
    + *will* driven by the *love of God*
+ separation of:
    + love and reason
        + as times goes, will becomes less and less driven by love, but by willpower alone
    + spirituality and science
        + the supernatural world is no longer viable/livable to us
+ axial wisdom falls apart: change in the nomological order: separation of reason and love
