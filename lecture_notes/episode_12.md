# Episode 12 - Higher States of Consciousness, Part 2

## Recap

+ HSC are central to the possibility of enlightenment
+ need to understand HSC from the cogsci perspective
    + why HSC lead to self-transformation, inner peace and connectedness to the world
+ (domain general) skill flowing in HSC is getting an optimal grip on the world
+ disruptive strategies
    + natural: mind wandering
    + induced by psychotechs: mindfulness
    + they increase variation, which helps find invariance, which helps find real causal patterns in the world
        + enhanced implicit processing
        + can lead to systematic insight or error
    + de-centering strategies
         + eg. the Solomon effect: use3rd person when describing interpersonal problems
             + solves the systematic error of egocentrism

## Descriptive Explanation of HSC

+ the __world__ is bright, intelligible, beautiful, interesting
+ __self__: inner peace, losing egocentrism, sense of oneness
+ __relationship__ between word and self: connectedness, con-formity, co-identification, participation
+ like Plato's anagoge, like Buddha's sati
+ HSC bring transformation, intervention in systematic error
    + but can also lead to increased self-deception when not integrated in a wisdom tradition, community:
        + the problem of autodidacts being stuck in an egocentric echo chamber
        + missing institutions of wisdom: Siddharta is an exception, need a sangha
    + __de-centering__ helps avoid being egocentrically trapped

### Changes in the Kinds of Knowing

#### Perspectival Knowing

+ HSC bring radical transformation of the salience landscape
+ change in the machinery of consciousness

#### Participatory Knowing - eg. Love

+ knowing by con-forming
+ HSC bring the experience of radical oneness:
    + changes in the machinery of the --> self --> character
    + reciprocal revelation:
        + world and self are revealed in a coupled fashion: like in love
+ love is a mutually accelerating disclosure
    + you know love by participating in it (like in culture, like in language)

### Cognitive/Psychological Explanation of HSC

+ flowing of optimal gripping
+ enhanced awareness of what is invariant --> find real patterns
+ de-centering --> becoming less ego-centered
+ exaptation of the self machinery:

#### Self as a Glue

+ the function of the self is glue relevant stuff together
    + the self is a set of integrating/complexifying processes
+ this gluing/integrating/complexifying process/machinery can be exapted:
    + capacity of gluing turned onto the world to reveal deeper patterns
        + and turn down the self-focus
    + intimacy of self-knowledge turned onto the world
    + moving to the being mode

### Information Processing (ML/AI) Explanation

#### Disruptive Strategies in Machine Learning (ML)

+ introducing randomization/noise into neural networks (NN)
    + "essential aspect of the self-optimization process"
+ to avoid overfitting (~ picking up on merely correlational patterns)
+ problem of sampling
    + the sample is never fully representative of the "population"
+ looking for the line of best fit  data *comprssion*
    + overfitting (low bias, high variance)
        + introduce noise: drop-out
    + underfitting (low accuracy; high bias, low variance)
    + best fit: may not touch any of the nodes
        + optimizing between disruptive variation and compression (~attention scaling)

### Neuroscientific Explanation

+ Newberg: brain activity during HSC
    1. first: increased activity (hyperactivity) in the frontal and parietal areas
        + areas associated with general intelligence (GI)
    2. sudden decrease (hypoactivity)
    3. throughout: increased activity in the thalamus
        + where different info are integrated together
+ the greater the (disruptive) shift (between 1. and 2.), more powerful the awakening experience is
    + ~insight: framing --> disruption --> breaking frame

#### Meta-stability

+ normally the brain is either integrating or segregating/differentiating
+ meta-stability: simultaneous integrating and segregating --> complexification
    + eg. from zygote to brain/lung cells
    + psilocybin is increasing meta-stability in the brain
+ emergent functions of complexification
    + I can do many thing because I'm highly differentiated
    + I don't fall apart as a system because I'm highly integrated
+ the way of growing/self-transcending as a system is by complexifying

## Prescriptive Explanation/Argument for HSC

Why should people pursue HSC ? Are HSC good states to trigger transformation ?

### Plausibility

+ as in "makes good sense" (not "highly probable")
+ you cannot base your action on certainty --> have to rely on plausibility
    + <-- the info available is infinitely vast
    + plausibility != certainty

#### Trustworthiness

+ a construct/model that have been produced by multiple independent, but converging lines of evidence
    + eg. info is more real if coming from multiple senses (ie. numbers)
+ reduces the probability of self-deception
+ background commitment (Milgram)

#### Multi-Aptness

+ a model/theory that can be applied in many independent domains
    + adaptive on many levels
    + highly functional
+ elegance, power
+ forward commitment (Milgram)

#### Fluency

+ need efficient fluency of processing

#### Balance between Trustworthiness/Convergence and Multi-Aptness/Elegance

1. high convergence, low elegance: triviality
2. low convergence, high elegance: conspiracy

Neither of 1. nor 2. transform.

#### Plausibility and Science

+ plausibility =! certainty
+ most scientific theories turn out to be false historically
+ science is not certainty & facts
+ science gives us self-correcting plausibility

Scientific process/experiment:

1. deciding which hypotheses to test
    + there are infinite amount
    + --> rely on plausibility judgements
2. deciding which explanation/variables to use
    + inference to the best explanation
    + there are infinite amount, cannot check all
    + --> rely on plausibility judgements
3. deciding how to interpret the results
    + there are infinite amount of interpretations
    + --> rely on plausibility judgement

> Plausibility is indispensable.

### Plausibility of HSC

+  high convergence/trustworthiness:
    + de-centering (reducing bias)
    + de-automatization (reducing bias)
+ fluency in processing
    + flowing state of optimal grip
+ multi-aptness/elegance:
    + affords a nexus for development (by finding systematic errors)
        + cognitive/psychological account
    + complexification of processing (getting emergent new functions)
        + exaptation machinery, new abilities, insight/self-machinery
        + neurosci account
    + optimization
        + tradeoff between detail and frame, variance and compression
        + info processing, cognitive accounts

HSC are deeply plausible states.

### Properties of HSC

+ optimization of processing --> optimal
+ state of high plausibility --> indispensable
+ fundamental of cognitive processing --> priority
    + (optimal grip, toggling between tradeoffs)

> Thus HSC are great guides on how to transform yourself:

+ IF set within wisdom/sapiential traditions.

> HSC do not give propositional knowledge.

+ there are no metaphysical revelances
+ participatory transformation:
    + getting wise practices, transformations
+ we have to take the wisdom from HSC and get it into rational discourse with an independently established (via science) metaphysics
+ rationality of wisdom != rationality of knowledge
